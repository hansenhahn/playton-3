Two men are moving boxes from the ground
floor to the top floor. The larger man can
carry two boxes at a time, and takes one
minute to get to the top floor. The smaller
man can only carry one box at a time, but
takes just 30 seconds to reach the top
floor. Both men take the same amount of
time to return to the ground floor as
they do to reach the top floor. The boxes
are too bulky to pass from one man to the
other on the way up.
If there were seven boxes in total, how
many minutes would it take the men to get
all the boxes to the top floor?
!******************************!
Correct!

It would take three minutes to get all
the boxes to the top floor. This puzzle
gets a lot easier if you make some notes.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Rather than just trying to work the
puzzle out in your head, use the
Memo Function to make some notes.
!******************************!
You can find the answer by doing a lot
of calculations, but it's much easier to
visualise if you use the Memo Function.

How many boxes have been moved after
one minute? And where are the two men
at that point?
!******************************!
After one minute, the larger man has
carried two boxes up and the smaller
man has carried one. The larger man is
still upstairs though, while the little
chap has made it back down to the
ground floor. 

If this is the case, what's their
progress after two minutes?
!******************************!
After two minutes, the larger fellow has
made it down to the ground floor again
and is ready to carry up some more
boxes. His friend has brought another
box upstairs, so there are a total of
four boxes on the top floor.

This means that there are just three
boxes left to move.
!******************************!
From the previous hints you know that
after two minutes, four boxes have been
brought upstairs, and both men are back
down on the ground floor. 

If it takes 30 seconds for the smaller
man to get upstairs with one box, and
the larger fellow can make it upstairs
with two boxes in a minute...
