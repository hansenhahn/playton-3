Here is a numberless clock face that
some prankster has rotated an unknown
amount. The clock is still running
normally, though, and each coloured
circle on its face represents an hour.

You can still tell what time it is without
the numbers. Write down the exact hour.

It doesn't matter whether it's am or pm,
but your answer should be in the form
of ?? o'clock.
!******************************!
You clocked it!

Yes, the answer is 12 o'clock. The only
time the two hands would point towards
the same hour on a clock like this is at
12 o'clock, though it's impossible to tell
if it's noon or midnight.

!******************************!
Too bad!

The answer should become apparent if you
picture a real clock.
!******************************!
The hour hand and the minute hand are
on top of each other, aren't they?
!******************************!
The hour and minute hands are on top of
each other. They're also pointing at
one of the hours.

The hour and minute hands are on top of
each other. They're also pointing at
one of the hours.

There's only one hour it could be.
!******************************!
Imagine the two hands pointing straight
up. That should give you your answer.
