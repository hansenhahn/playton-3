Your task is to make the top and bottom
cogs turn in the same direction, as shown
by the arrows on the diagram.

In order to do this, which extra cog
should be inserted, A, B or C?

Touch the letter in the centre of the
correct cog to submit your answer.
!******************************!
Excellent!

The answer is B. If there is an odd number
of cogs between the top and bottom cogs,
then those two cogs will move in the same
direction. If there's an even number of
cogs, however, they will move in opposite
directions.
 
By choosing B, there will be five cogs
between the two main cogs, so the
direction of their rotation will be the
same.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Try using the Memo Function to mark the
direction in which each cog moves.
!******************************!
To find out how to make both the top
and bottom cogs turn in the same
direction, try following the cogs from
one end to the other, checking the
direction of each one.

You do realise that two adjacent cogs
always turn in opposite directions,
don't you?
!******************************!
With the method explained in Hint 1,
you can systematically check the
rotation sequence of the cogs when
A, B and C are inserted.

However, there is an even quicker way
to work out the answer. Try reading
Hint 1 again.
!******************************!
As you know from Hint 1, adjacent cogs
move in opposite directions. If three
cogs were lined up, the second cog
would move in the opposite direction
to the first, but the third cog would
move in the same direction as the first.
Thinking along these lines, any two cogs
that have an odd number of cogs
between them will always move in the
same direction. Any two cogs with an
even number of cogs between them will
move in different directions.
!******************************!
If you insert cog A, there will be four
cogs between the top and bottom cogs.

If you insert cog B, there will be five
cogs between the two main cogs.

Finally, inserting cog C would mean
there are four cogs between top and
bottom, the same as when cog A is
inserted.
