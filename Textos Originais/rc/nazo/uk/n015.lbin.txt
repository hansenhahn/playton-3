That{9}s right!

Sunday.
One week is seven days. If you're asked
{''}What day was it X days ago?{''} or {''}What
day will it be X days from today?{''} and X
is divisible by seven, then you know that
it will be the same day as today.
!******************************!
Too bad.

Don't let the numbers confuse you.
!******************************!
If you think in terms of big numbers,
you'll get confused, so try thinking in
terms of smaller numbers.

For example, if seven days after 14 days
ago is Wednesday, what day is today?
!******************************!
Seven days after 70 days ago is nine
weeks ago. So if that day was a Sunday, 
what day would it be today?
!******************************!
The thinking is the same for seven days
before 70 days from now. Today is a
Sunday, and the question is asking which
day it will be nine weeks from today.

Now you get it, right?
!******************************!
If you know which day of the week
it is, then you know which day it is
{''}X weeks before{''} or {''}X weeks after{''}.

It's the same day as today.
