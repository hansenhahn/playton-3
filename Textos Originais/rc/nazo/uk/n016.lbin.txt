It seems you need to enter a number to
open the door. The only clue you have
is a hastily written note from a woman
known for her poor handwriting.

Can you work out the number you need?
!******************************!
Exactly right!

The number you need is 8. If you look at
the note in the right way, you can see
that it says {''}121 - 113 ={''}, so of course
the answer is 8.
!******************************!
Too bad!

If only you could find some numbers in the
note...
!******************************!
It looks like RHB, you say?

No, that's not the right track at all.
Try looking at things in a different way.
!******************************!
The answer is a number, so perhaps
these scrawls are numbers too?

The mark at the end looks a bit like an
equals sign (=), doesn't it?
!******************************!
The note is an equation, consisting
of two three-digit numbers.

Take a closer look!
!******************************!
The note actually reads {''}121 - 113 ={''}.
If you can find the answer to that,
you have the answer to the puzzle.
