A doctor has to visit nine hospital rooms
on her rounds. The numbers of the rooms
she needs to visit are listed below. When
checking the room numbers she notices
that if she always proceeds to a room
with at least one digit in common with the
room she's currently in, she can visit all
the rooms in one trip.

Which will be the fifth room she visits on
such a trip?

Circle the correct room number.
!******************************!
That's right!

Room 63. The digits 2 and 7 are only used
once, while the rest of the digits are
used at least twice, so her route through
the nine rooms is as in the image above.
Whether you start from room 29 or 71,
the fifth room will always be 63.
!******************************!
Too bad.

Look closely at the numbers.
!******************************!
Look at all the digits used in every
room number. How often is each digit
used?
!******************************!
There are some digits that are only
used once. This means that if you're
in a room with a number that contains
one of these digits, the only room
numbers you can proceed to are those
that contain the other digit.
!******************************!
Out of the nine digits, the ones that
are only used once are 2 and 7. The room
numbers that contain these digits are
29 and 71. You have to visit these rooms
either first or last.
!******************************!
If you start from room 29, the order is
29-49-54.

If you start from room 71, the order is
71-18-38.

And if 29 and 71 are the start and end
of your rounds...
