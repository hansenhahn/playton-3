Dr Schrader needs to drink one fifth of
this bottle of medicine per day over a
period of five days. Unfortunately, the
dosages aren't marked on the bottle.

Dr Schrader has taken the first dose, and
the amount of medicine in the bottle has
been reduced to the level shown in the
diagram. It's now time for the second
dose.

To where should he drink today? Draw a
line on the bottle to mark the point at
which he should stop drinking.
!******************************!
That's right!

You can rotate the bottle left or right
and get the same result. Just make sure
the medicine reaches the line you drew.

Looking at the diagram, you can see that
a diagonal line like the one shown divides
the rectangle into two. Since the
rectangle makes up two fifths of the
medicine, halving it gives you just the
right amount!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Look at the shape of the bottle again and
work out how to find the right dose for
Dr Schrader.
!******************************!
It's easy to divide the medicine into 
five doses when looking at the bottle 
from the bottom. If each square
contains one dose, then on the first
day you would drink one square, and
on the second day you'd drink one more.
!******************************!
No matter how you tilt the bottle,
there's no way of getting the medicine
to lie evenly within the outlines of the
squares. You must therefore find the
required dosage by dividing the squares
another way. For example, you could try
combining two adjacent squares that
make a rectangle, then drawing a
diagonal line through the middle. The
resulting triangle would contain the
same amount of medicine as one of the
squares.
!******************************!
Try finding the kind of rectangles
talked about in Hint 2. You can create
two horizontal rectangles using the
centre square and the square to its
left or right.
!******************************!
You've got to draw a line through one
of the two rectangles talked about in
Hint 3.

Think about the angle of this line.
