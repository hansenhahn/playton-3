Here's a painting of two players in fierce
competition over a game of cards.

At first glance, nothing seems strange,
but occasionally people remark:
{''}If they're really in fierce competition,
isn't this part of the painting strange?{''}

Circle the part of the painting that
people would find strange, then touch

!******************************!
That's right! 

Cards usually have their number displayed
in the top-left and bottom-right corners.

No matter how badly he wants to win,
therefore, the player in the orange hat is
going to have a hard time seeing his hand
if he's holding his cards like that.
!******************************!
Too bad.

Try considering how things would look from
a different perspective!
!******************************!
Imagine you were there, playing cards at
this table.

Is there anything you find unusual?
!******************************!
This painting is of two chaps in
fierce competition.

Look closely at the players.
!******************************!
Have you given some thought to the
characteristics of playing cards?

Look carefully at the cards the
man in the foreground is holding.

The location of the number on the
cards is a clue. 
!******************************!
Where is a card's number displayed?
Not in the top-right or bottom-left
corner, that's for sure.

If you think about this and look at
what the players are doing, you'll
see something that's unnatural for a
fiercely competitive card game.
