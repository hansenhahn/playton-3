This tomcat is trying to meet up with his
sweetheart. However, there are dogs on
the squares marked with Xs, and if the
tomcat comes within three squares of one,
they'll pick up his scent and chase him
off. Rest assured that the dogs can't
smell through walls, though.

Which entrance, out of A, B, C and D
should the tomcat take so that he can be
safely reunited with his lady friend?


!******************************!
Purrrfect!

The answer is C. Reunited at last!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Might you have overlooked something?
!******************************!
Trying to find the safe path by
starting at each entrance in turn is
hard work.

Start by thinking about where the
dogs are.
!******************************!
Where is the tomcat in danger of
being noticed by the dogs?

Using the Memo Function to fill in
the dangerous areas might prove
helpful.
!******************************!
Did you try filling in the dangerous
squares? Didn't doing that reveal a
safe path?
!******************************!
On the dangerous paths, the tomcat
can't turn more than three corners
without running into a dog. If he can
clear four corners safely, you know
he's on the right path!
