To open the door, place four numbered
tiles in the blank spaces so that all the
conditions set forth by the equations are
fulfilled.

Placing a numbered tile into a blank space
enters it into the equations in the
positions above and below that space.
!******************************!
Brilliant!

Here is one possible solution. The right
and left halves of each equation are
interchangeable. Additionally, since each
half of the equations involves the
addition or multiplication of a pair of
numbers, the order of numbers in each
pair can be switched without affecting
the overall result.
!******************************!
Too bad!

It's a combination of simple numbers.
Just keep trying.
!******************************!
It's difficult to choose the correct 
numbers, even though there are only 
four of them. Just keep trying 
different possibilities.
!******************************!
Think of two pairs of two numbers that
produce the same value when the
numbers in one pair are multiplied and
the numbers in the other pair are added
together, and vice versa.
!******************************!
The two numbers on each side of the
equation should produce the same result
when they are multiplied as when they
are added together, so large numbers
won't work.
!******************************!
When the solution to the top equation
is six, the solution to the bottom
equation is five.
