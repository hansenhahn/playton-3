Inserting one of the blocks (A, B, C or D)
into the space marked {''}?{''} reveals a
hidden message.

Touch the letter of the correct block.
!******************************!
Quite right!

The answer is block B, which is shaped like
the letter O. When you insert that block
into the space and line up all the blocks,
they spell out {''}LAYTON{''}!
!******************************!
Too bad!

You need to look at this puzzle from
various angles. 
!******************************!
Are the blocks' complicated shapes
confusing you?

Here's a hint: each block represents
something.

!******************************!
The upper blocks are letters.

Try to work out which letter each block
at the top represents.
!******************************!
As we all know, the main character in
this game is Professor Layton. Think
about that for a second...
!******************************!
As Hint 3 alluded to, the upper sequence
of blocks almost spells out {''}LAYTON{''}.

Which letter is needed to complete the
word?
