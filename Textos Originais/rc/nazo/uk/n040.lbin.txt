Barton needs to park his police car in
the space indicated by the flag. When he
encounters a cross, he has to turn left
or right. When he meets a circle, he must
keep going straight.

Assuming he's not allowed to reverse the
car, which route does Barton need to take
in order to reach the parking space?

Draw a line from the police car to the
parking space. As you can see, the parking
space can only be entered from one side.

!******************************!
Nice driving!

Barton has to go all the way around the
parking space in order to get there.

Though you showed him the route he
needed to take, all those turns seem to
have confused Barton. He's written off
the police car and the inspector's not
happy!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Barton must have turned or gone straight
where he wasn't supposed to.
!******************************!
Immediately after the starting point,
Barton has to turn left or right. He'll
be wanting to turn left here.
!******************************!
The path Barton needs to take goes
straight along the second row from the
top, from the left all the way over to
the right.

Try and find a way to get from the
starting point to the leftmost square
in the second row.
!******************************!
Barton has to do a little loop through
the four squares in the top-right and
again through the four squares in the
bottom-right.

He'll be very close to the parking
space after this second loop.
!******************************!
Barton needs to approach the square in
front of the parking space from the
right, and then turn right into the
parking space.
