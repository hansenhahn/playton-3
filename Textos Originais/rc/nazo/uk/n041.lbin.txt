Here are three sheets of transparent
plastic with different patterns painted
on them. If you layer them correctly,
a chessboard pattern appears.

The order in which you layer them is
important, and you can't flip or rotate
the sheets.

Which sheet, A, B or C, goes on the very
bottom? Touch a letter to give your
answer.
!******************************!
Nicely done!

B goes on the very bottom, and the other
sheets are laid on top in the order
pictured above.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think carefully about how the sheets
should be layered.
!******************************!
You're not trying to build the entire
chessboard in your head at once, are
you? That will only confuse you.

Try focusing on just one part of the
board initially.
!******************************!
The layered sheets must make a
chessboard pattern. In some areas,
the pattern won't appear until you
have layered all three sheets, though.
 
Keep this in mind and try to work out
which sheet could go on top of the pile.
!******************************!
A sheet that contains adjacent squares
of the same colour can't go on top.
!******************************!
Sheets A and B contain adjacent
squares of the same colour. If you
put either of these sheets on top,
you won't have a chessboard pattern.
In other words, you know that C goes
on top.

Now that you know this, think about
which colours need to fit into the blank
squares of sheet C.
