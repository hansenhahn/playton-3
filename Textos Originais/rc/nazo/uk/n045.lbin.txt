Move the red and blue blocks to the
spaces of the same colour. Touch the
arrow buttons at the bottom to rotate
the board 90 degrees. Blocks fall
downwards when there's nothing beneath
them.

Give it a try!
!******************************!
Superb!

How many moves did it take you?
Could you do it in five?
!******************************!
Too bad!

Give it another try.
!******************************!
Rotate the board enough times and
you're sure to get there eventually!
!******************************!
Think about moving the blue block
first. Everything should fall into
place for you after that.
!******************************!
If you're having trouble, you might
be tempted to keep restarting the
puzzle, but don't give in to temptation,
keep rotating the board!
!******************************!
Rotate the board five times in a
certain direction...
