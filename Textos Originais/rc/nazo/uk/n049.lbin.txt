This young student has drawn five shapes
on the blackboard, but one of them is not
quite right.

Circle the shape that doesn't belong.
!******************************!
Excellent!

The other shapes are made up of three
3s, four 4s, five 5s and seven 7s. This
shape is neither six 6s nor nine 9s.

!******************************!
Too bad!

These shapes are somewhat strange, but
they are not without meaning.
!******************************!
Try drawing some of these shapes
yourself. Drawing them might give
you a hint as to how they are formed.
!******************************!
Have you noticed that all the shapes
are made up of numbers?

Think about the relationship between
each shape and its corresponding
number.
!******************************!
One shape is made of three 3s,
one of four 4s...

There is a correlation between the
number used in each shape and how
many of it the shape contains. With
that in mind, can you work out which
shape is the odd one out?
!******************************!
One of the shapes is made up of a
number that can be read either the
right way up or upside down.

Consider how many of this number the
shape contains and you will see that
this shape doesn't follow the rule.
