Two squares of paper, A and B, are shown
below. Each piece of paper has been folded
in half and then folded in half again, as
shown in the images. The dotted red line
on the rightmost image of paper A shows
where a cut will be made.

Your task is to cut paper B so that when
you unfold it, the cut-out shape in the
middle matches the hole in the middle of
paper A when it's unfolded.

Draw the cut you need to make on the
rightmost image of paper B.
!******************************!
You made the cut!

As shown in the image above, both pieces
of paper will have the same shape cut out
of the middle when unfolded.

Why not get a few pieces of paper and
try it out yourself? It's fun!
!******************************!
Too bad!

It might be easier to grab a few pieces of
paper to try working it out that way, but
try solving it in your head first.

If you were convinced your solution would
work, perhaps you're making your cut too
big or too small.
!******************************!
Imagine what paper A will look like after
it's been cut and unfolded. Work that
out first and go from there.
!******************************!
When unfolded, paper A will have a
square cut out of its centre that has
been rotated 45 degrees from the
square outline of the paper.

When trying to match this shape, be
careful to match the size as well.
!******************************!
You can do it with just one straight
line.
!******************************!
Diagonally cut off the correct corner
of paper B and you'll cut out the same
shape as the one cut from paper A. The
key is not to cut off too much or too
little.
