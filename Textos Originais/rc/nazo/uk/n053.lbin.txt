Arrange these books of equal thickness
on the shelf according to the rules below:
{.} There are no books to the left of the
brown one. 
{.} Only the blue book touches the brown
one.
{.} The yellow book is to the left of the
white one.
{.} The blue book touches the purple one.
{.} The white book is sandwiched between the
yellow and purple books, but touches no
other.
{.} There's an empty space for one book
next to the yellow one.
!******************************!
That's right!

Placing the blue book horizontally on
top of the others makes it work.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Remember, it doesn't matter how tidily the
books are arranged as long as you meet
all the conditions.
!******************************!
If there are no books to the left of
the brown one, the chances are it goes
on the far left of the shelf.
!******************************!
The third and fifth clues reveal how
to line up the yellow, white and
purple books. From left to right,
put them in the following order:
yellow, white, then purple.

!******************************!
From the second and fourth clues, you
should be able to deduce where the blue
book goes.

However, if you're trying to stand all
the books vertically, it will be impossible
to meet all the conditions. Take away 
this constraint and there's only one
place you can put the blue book...
!******************************!
If standing all the books upright
doesn't work, try putting one in
sideways.

When you put all except the blue book in,
can you see a space at the top? That's
where the blue book goes.
