To be prepared in case of future
shortages, you've decided to mill some
of your grain into flour and stash it
away somewhere safe and dry.

You've rustled up three different boxes
that are suitable for storage.

Which of these containers will store the
most flour?
!******************************!
Swheeeeeeeeeeat!

Box A is correct. It will store the
most flour if you turn it upside down.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Consider all the options carefully.
!******************************!
You'll be storing flour, which is a type
of powder, so you need a container
that's both big and deep.

Which one best fits this description?
!******************************!
If you compare boxes A and C, they're
about the same size. Their lids, however,
are completely different.

Box B looks too small to even consider
choosing.
!******************************!
If two of the boxes are the same size,
the one with the bigger lid would appear
to be less useful, right?

Unless there's another way of looking
at it...
!******************************!
Imagine all the boxes were turned upside
down. Which box could hold the most now?
!******************************!
