Bowls of plain noodles and pork noodles
are lined up in a row on the counter.

Line up the bowls so that bowls of plain
noodles and pork noodles alternate, but
make sure they all remain evenly spaced.

What is the fewest number of moves it
would take to accomplish this task?

Note that in this puzzle, simply switching
the places of two bowls counts as two
moves!
!******************************!
That's using your noodle!

Just move the pork from one bowl
to another!
!******************************!
Too bad.

Are the bowls evenly spaced?
!******************************!
Isn't this the same as last time?

Well, no, actually. It's a bit different.
Don't be afraid to try out different
things.
!******************************!
A bowl of plain noodles. A bowl of pork
noodles. What exactly is the difference
between the two dishes?

Poke around a bit with your stylus and
see what you can find...
!******************************!
Whoa! You can just move the pork?!
!******************************!
Counting from left to right, move the
pork from the fourth bowl to the fifth
bowl. And...you're done!

Now, how many moves was that?
