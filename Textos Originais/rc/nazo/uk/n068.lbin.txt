16 circular rooms are arranged in a
square as shown below. Beams of light
shine in straight lines from each of the
four letters, A, B, C and D, and exit
through the four yellow arrows. Two-sided
mirrors in four of the rooms reflect
these beams. Each beam passes through
the number of rooms listed next to its
letter.

Identify which four rooms contain mirrors
and the direction each mirror faces.
Touch the rooms to add or remove mirrors
and change their direction.

Dazzling!

Right then, let's press on!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Remember, only four of the rooms
contain mirrors. You're not trying
to place more than that, are you?
!******************************!
It is possible to make the beams pass
through the correct number of rooms by
putting mirrors in five of the rooms,
but you need a solution where only four
of the rooms have mirrors.

Don't forget that the mirrors are
two-sided!
!******************************!
Beam C exits without reflecting off a
single mirror.

!******************************!
Beam A is only reflected by one mirror.
!******************************!
Beam B is only reflected once.

Beam D is reflected three times and
exits at the top-right arrow.

That should do the trick!
