There is only one way to get across this 
room. In order to proceed, you have to
work out how to put the four pieces of
the Dragon Walkway back together!

The spiked ball can also be moved freely.
!******************************!
You did it!

Future Layton awaits on the other side
of the Dragon Walkway!

!******************************!
Too bad!

Better give it another shot.
!******************************!
The dragon's head is at the top, its tail
at the bottom.

Try to visualise the finished Dragon
Walkway before you start moving the
pieces.
!******************************!
You need to deal with the spiked ball
by moving it off to the left and
then sliding it over against the right
wall. To clear the way, move the
sideways T-shaped piece to the right,
then slide the S-shaped piece down to
the left of it. Now you can move the
spiked ball down and to the left, and
if you move the dragon's tail to the
left and up, you can slide the spiked
ball all the way against the wall to
the right.
!******************************!
Slide the sideways T-shaped piece
above the S-shaped piece and flush
with the left wall. Move the
dragon's head and then the spiked ball
to the bottom-centre. You can now
move the dragon's tail to the
bottom-right. Move the spiked ball
against the right wall, then move
the sideways T-shaped piece to the
top-centre and the S-shaped piece
below it and to the left.
!******************************!
Move the dragon's head to the
bottom-left corner to open up the
middle. Slide the dragon's tail down
into the bottom-centre space, then
move the S-shaped piece down on top
of the dragon's tail.

You're nearly there! Work out the
last few moves and the Dragon Walkway
will take shape before your eyes!
