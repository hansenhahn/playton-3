Move the three coloured blocks to their
respective spaces. Touch the arrow
buttons at the bottom to rotate the
board 90 degrees. Blocks fall downwards
when there's nothing beneath them.

All three blocks must be in place in order
to complete this puzzle.

Give it a try!
!******************************!
Amazing!

Even when the number of blocks increases,
the way you do the puzzle stays the same.
It's easy if you keep your cool...right?

!******************************!
Too bad.

Try again!
!******************************!
You've got three blocks to deal with
this time!

There's no need to panic, though.
Keep calm and carry on!
!******************************!
Are the yellow and red blocks' positions
the wrong way round? Look closely. You
can switch them easily.
!******************************!
Here are the first steps for moving
the positions of the red and yellow
blocks.
Rotate the playing field five times
using the right-hand button, once with
the left-hand button and then once
more with the right-hand button.

Make sure you watch the movements
carefully, though. The next step is
a hard one.
!******************************!
From where Hint 3 left off, touch the
right-hand button, then the left-hand
one.

You should be able to work out the rest
from here.
