For each of the four squares below,
there is a way to display all the
numbers from zero to nine. Touch the
four buttons, A, B, C and D, to change
the numbers according to a hidden set
of rules.

Work out the hidden rules and set all
the numbers to zero.
!******************************!
Wonderful job!

Button A adds five, B adds three,
C adds seven and D adds four.

You must have worked that out. Unless
you're one of those people that just
kept pounding the buttons until they
set everything to zero...
!******************************!
Too bad!

Better try again.
!******************************!
Notice that when a number goes over
nine, the counter starts again at zero.
In other words, the numbers are on a
loop, so touch the buttons as many
times as you like. It won't mess
anything up.

If you touch each button several times
and pay close attention to what each
one does, the rules should become clear.
!******************************!
The coloured rectangle connected
to each button indicates the two
squares that it affects. When a button
is touched, the two numbers within
its coloured rectangle increase
according to a hidden rule. Study what
happens to the numbers when you touch
each button.
!******************************!
Button A adds five.
Button B adds three.

It shouldn't be too hard to work out
the rules for buttons C and D now.

But even knowing the rules, how do
you turn all the numbers to zero?
!******************************!
Don't get too frustrated if you're
still stuck. This puzzle is tricky.

To solve it, don't touch button A at
first, instead touch buttons C and D
until the numbers in A's rectangle are
both five. After that, you'll be able to
solve it in no time.
