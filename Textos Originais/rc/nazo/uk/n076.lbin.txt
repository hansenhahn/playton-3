{''}In the course of his research, Father
discovered a very significant number and
noted it on a slip of paper.

Unfortunately, somebody mistook this
note for a piece of rubbish and tore it
up into pieces! Now Father is hopping
mad and Mother is beside herself...

Perhaps you can work out the number
by piecing the note back together?{''}
!******************************!
That's it!

{''}The number is 74!

And don't tell anybody, but the person
who tore up the note? It was me...{''}
!******************************!
Too bad!

Did you line up all the pieces
correctly? Take another look.
!******************************!
Did you put the pieces back together
carefully? If you do it correctly, the
answer should reveal itself.
!******************************!
The number isn't written down. Did you
notice there are some edges that fit
together perfectly and some that
don't?
!******************************!
If you line up all the edges that
fit together perfectly, the gaps
in the middle will reveal a number.
!******************************!
Did you notice the number that's formed
by the gaps between the pieces?
That's your answer. It's two digits.
