Here's a strange construction site. You
have to inspect every ladder and girder,
starting from the arrow and passing
through points A, B, C and D in order.

You never take the same route twice,
except to pass over or under a ladder.
In what order do you use the white
ladders?

Drag the numbered ladders over the white
ladders to indicate their order.

!******************************!
That's right!

No matter which route you take, the three
ladders get used in the same order.

These routes may seem inefficient, but no
matter which one you take, since you
can't go the same way twice, the distance
travelled is the same. 
!******************************!
Too bad.

Take your time and give it some thought.
!******************************!
It looks complicated, but it's just
one unbroken line.

Keep your thought process simple.
!******************************!
There is more than one route you can
take, but the order in which you use
the white ladders is always the same.
!******************************!
Head straight down the white ladder
under the starting point to get to A.
There's your first ladder.
!******************************!
As mentioned in Hint 3, use the ladder
under the starting point to get to A.
That's the first ladder. Don't use a
white ladder to get from A to B. This
should be all the information you need.

All you have to do now is decide on the
order of the other two ladders.
