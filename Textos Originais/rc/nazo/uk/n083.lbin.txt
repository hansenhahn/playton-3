Make your way from the green square to
the red square, one step at a time.

What's the catch? Well, you can only move
to numbers that are one higher or lower
than your current number.

Reach the red goal square following this
rule and the door will open. Each number
you touch will light up. Make sure all the
squares on your route are lit up before
submitting your answer.
!******************************!
Success!

You found the correct path!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Remember, you can only move to numbers
that differ by one from your current
number.

Keep this simple rule in mind and give it
another try.
!******************************!
It may seem like there are many
junctions, but choose your path
carefully and you'll be all right.

!******************************!
Don't let the numbers get too large.
If you reach a seven, you've made a
mistake. When you reach a six, your
next step should be to a five.

Think you can solve it now?
!******************************!
If you're stuck, try going from the red
goal square to the green start square.
There's only one path you can initially
take in that direction.
!******************************!
The correct path is:

1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
