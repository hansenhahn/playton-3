How to open:

{''}Start from a button and follow the
arrows from one button to the next.
Find the only button that will lead
you through all the other buttons
on the panel!{''}

Can you work out which button leads
through all the rest?

Touch the button to mark it!
!******************************!
That's the one!

Did you find the button that doesn't
point to any other button and work
backwards from there?

The starting button isn't pointed at
by any other button either, so that's
another way to solve this puzzle.
!******************************!
Too bad!

The answer shouldn't be too difficult
once you understand the conditions of
the puzzle. Give it another try!
!******************************!
Instead of looking for the starting
button, try looking for the end button
and work backwards. Bear in mind that
the arrow on the end button won't point
to any other button.
!******************************!
The end button doesn't point to any
other button, so it must be a button
on the edge that points outwards.
Once you've found the end point, you
can work your way backwards to find
the starting button!
!******************************!
The end point is the button in the
top-right corner. Work backwards
from there to find the start!
!******************************!
The starting button isn't pointed at
by any other button. Can you find it?
That's your answer!
