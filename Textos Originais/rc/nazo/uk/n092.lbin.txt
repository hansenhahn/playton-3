So, what's the key code?

Apparently you can arrange these 10
pieces to form the answer.

Move and rotate the pieces to find the
key code, then touch <CR>Input Answer</C> to
enter it.
!******************************!
That's right!

The answer is 081127.
It becomes clear when you put the
pieces together in the right way.
Now you know the key code!
!******************************!
Bad luck.

Make sure you have the pieces correctly
positioned and it will be obvious.
!******************************!
Start by inserting the pieces that go
on the ends and those that have a
distinctive shape.
!******************************!
Each piece can be inserted in various
positions by being rotated different
ways. However, there is only one pattern
that will allow all the pieces to be
inserted.

Keep on trying!
!******************************!
The first digit in the key code is 0
and the last digit is 7.

There's a 1 in there as well.
Have you worked it out yet?
!******************************!
There are two 1s in the code. Next
to one of them, there is a 2.

The hints have told you what five of
the six digits are already.

Go on, insert the key code!
