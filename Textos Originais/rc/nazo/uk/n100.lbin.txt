{''}Hey Professor! All the information about
our next adventure is in this sealed
document! Do you like my seal, by the way?
It's just like the one you use, except it
looks like my hat and the L stands for
Luke! The colour even matches my hat!
In fact, the seal has made me think of a
puzzle: of the four examples, A, B, C and
D, which one is my actual stamp?
You have to solve this puzzle before
breaking the seal!{''}

Circle your answer and touch <CR>Submit</C>.
!******************************!
Lovely!
 
The challenge is working out the
differences between the various hat
shapes and realising that the L on
the stamp should be backwards.
 
It's rather nice that the L works for
both Luke and Layton! Handy, eh?
 
{''}Hurry up, Professor! Break the seal and
read the document!{''}
!******************************!
Too bad!

{''}Come on, Professor! You have to read
the document I've sealed inside!{''}
!******************************!
Keep in mind that a stamp will print
a mirror image of its actual design.
!******************************!
The stamps are all circular, so pay close
attention to what's in the centre: the
outline of a hat and an L.

First off, take a look at the direction
the L is facing...
!******************************!
Stamp B doesn't have the L correctly
reversed, so you can eliminate that
option.

Now look closely at the hat shapes
of stamps A, C and D.
!******************************!
The top part of the hat shape in stamp
A is touching the outer circle, so you
can safely eliminate that option.

It's just between stamps C and D now!
!******************************!
