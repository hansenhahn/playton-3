Below are two necklaces, a gold one on the
left and a silver one on the right.

Can you make them switch sides by sliding
the blocks around?
!******************************!
Fantabulous job!

Square-shaped slide puzzles like this
usually have 15 blocks and only one
empty space. This one, however, has two
empty spaces, so it couldn't have been
that hard for you!

By the way, where did these necklaces
come from? Does anybody know? Or might
they be...stolen?!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Try again.
!******************************!
You need to move the silver necklace
over to the left side and the gold
necklace over to the right.

Did you notice that there are two empty
spaces to work with? This should make
it fairly easy. Just keep moving those
blocks around and you'll see!
!******************************!
Unlike a lot of slide puzzles, this one
has two empty spaces. If you take
advantage of them both, switching the
necklaces is actually pretty simple.
!******************************!
The key is to not worry about the
position of the individual blocks, but
rather to simply switch all the blocks
of each necklace to the opposite side.

After you've done that, you can begin
to reassemble each necklace.

Keep trying, you can do it!
Even if you decide to use the Super
Hint, it won't tell you exactly how
to solve it...
!******************************!
You couldn't resist, could you?
Okay then.

Switching the necklaces around is easy
if you utilise both of the open spaces.
Keep the two open spaces above, below,
or to the side of the two blocks you
want to reposition and you should have
no problem manoeuvring them around
one another. Give it a try! You'll see.
