You have eight jars of jam of four
different types, depicted by the
different colours. The different types
of jam vary in weight. Your jars have
been put into boxes in pairs.

Use the scales to work out the relative
weight of each type of jam and rank them
1 to 4, with 1 being the lightest and 4
the heaviest.
!******************************!
Well done!

Starting with the heaviest, the order is:
blue, yellow, green, red.

By weighing the red-blue box with the
red-green box, you can work out that blue
jam is heavier than green jam. Weighing
red-blue with blue-green tells you that
green jam is heavier than red jam.
Finally, by ascertaining that yellow-yellow
is the same weight as blue-green, you can
work out that the weight of yellow jam is
between that of blue jam and green jam.
!******************************!
Too bad.

There's a certain knack to knowing which
boxes to weigh together.
!******************************!
There are some boxes that have one
type of jam in common. By weighing
these boxes together you can compare
the weight of the two jams that aren't
the same.
!******************************!
Try weighing the red-blue box with
the red-green box.

This way you can find out which one is
heavier, the blue jam or green jam.
!******************************!
Picking up from where Hint 2 left off,
the next step is to check the relative
weight of the red jam.

In order to do this, weigh the red-blue
box with the blue-green box. You'll find
that the red jam is lighter than the
green jam, which gives you a partial
order: blue, green, red.
!******************************!
Imagine that a jar of blue jam has a
weight of 300 g, green has a weight of
200 g and red, 100 g.

The yellow-yellow box and the blue-green
box weigh the same, so 2 jars of yellow
jam weigh 300 g + 200 g = 500 g.

One jar of yellow jam therefore
weighs 250 g.
