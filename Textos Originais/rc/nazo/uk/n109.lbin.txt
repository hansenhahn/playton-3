You have 15 biscuits to share among a
large group. The first person eats one
biscuit and then passes two equal shares
of the remaining biscuits to two other
people. They both eat a biscuit, and both
pass two equal shares of their remaining
biscuits to two other people, and so on
until all the biscuits are gone.

It takes one minute to eat a biscuit.
Ignoring the time it takes to pass them,
what's the shortest amount of time, in
minutes, that it would take for all the
biscuits to be eaten?
!******************************!
Crumbs!

The biscuits will be gone in four minutes.

The diagram above shows how you can
visualise the puzzle to help you solve it.
This seems like the kind of thing that
might be useful in real life, but it's
not a situation that arises very often,
is it?
!******************************!
Too bad!

Clear your mind and think about it again.
!******************************!
Drawing a diagram is the quickest way of
working this one out.
!******************************!
Try and break the problem down into
numbers. If one of the 15 biscuits is
eaten, that means 14 are left. Divide
those 14 equally between two people,
and they get seven each. That's taken
one minute so far.

Think about the problem in concrete
mathematical terms like this and
you should be able to work it out.
!******************************!
The two people who get seven biscuits
eat one biscuit each, which takes one
minute. They both have six biscuits
left, which they each divide between
two people, giving those people three
biscuits each. That's two minutes so
far.
!******************************!
All the people who receive three
biscuits eat one of them, so they each
have two remaining. Three minutes have
elapsed at this point.

If you divide these two biscuits between
the next people in line, giving them one
each, how many more minutes will it take
for the biscuits to be gone?
