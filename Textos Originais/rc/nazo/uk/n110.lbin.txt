{''}Prepare to be amazed! Once while
travellin' on a train, I came to the
realisation that I knew exactly which
station this complete stranger was goin'
to get off at. Further evidence of my
psychic gift!{''}

This man doesn't really have any psychic
powers. In fact, anybody could have made
the same correct prediction. Which train
was he travelling on?

Circle your answer, A, B, C or D, and then
touch <CR>Submit</C>.
!******************************!
Full steam ahead!

Train D is the right answer.

It is the only train that can reach one
end of the line without passing another
station, so you know that all the
passengers have to get off at the next
stop.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Remember, the man doesn't really have any
psychic powers, and anybody could make
the same correct prediction.
!******************************!
You're not overthinking it, are you? If
you were on the same train as this
chap, you would know which station the
stranger would get off at as well.
!******************************!
Imagine the train only stopped at one
station. Anybody could predict where
the stranger would get off then!
!******************************!
Out of the four trains, which one might
stop at only one station?
!******************************!
If a train is coming up to the last
station on the line, you know for sure
that all the passengers will get off at
the next stop.

Yes, it's that simple!
