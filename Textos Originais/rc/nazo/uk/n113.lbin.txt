This old brick wall has been decorated
with an unusual design.
Five different shapes have been painted
on a white background as shown.
Just by looking at the picture, you should
be able to tell which colour of paint was
used the most. So, which one was it?

Touch the tin of paint that was used the
most.
!******************************!
That's right!

White.
The white background used the most paint,
without a doubt.
!******************************!
Too bad.

Imagine that you were going to paint
the wall yourself. You should be able
to work it out.
!******************************!
It isn't wrong to calculate the area
taken up by each coloured shape, but
there's got to be an easier way...
!******************************!
You're not counting the number of
bricks for every colour, are you?

Though even doing it that way, you
should get the answer as long as you
don't overlook anything...
!******************************!
The colours used are red, yellow, green,
black and blue.

There aren't any more, are there?
!******************************!
No matter how large the painted shapes
are, they can never be bigger than the
background.
