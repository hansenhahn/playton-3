It's your job to paint a pyramid built
from 21 circular pieces of wood. You've
been given three colours to work with:
red, blue and yellow.
Before you get too creative, however,
there's one important rule you need to
follow: no two pieces of wood that are
next to each other can be painted the
same colour.

One piece has already been painted red. If
you follow the rule and finish painting the
entire pyramid, what colour will piece A be?
Circle the correctly coloured paint tin.
!******************************!
Bullseye!

The image above shows the two possible
ways of following the rule and painting
the entire pyramid. Notice that either
way results in piece A being red. Cool, eh?
!******************************!
Too bad!

Don't overthink it. There's only one
right answer.
!******************************!
There's more than one way to paint the
pyramid, but piece A will end up being
the same colour no matter how you do it.
!******************************!
Don't forget about the mighty Memo
Function. You can use three different
colours to help you work it out.
!******************************!
There are two possible ways to follow
the rule and paint the entire pyramid.
The order of blue and yellow around the
original red piece can be switched
around.
!******************************!
You learnt in Hint 3 that the order
of blue and yellow pieces can be
switched around, which means that one
colour's position is fixed...
