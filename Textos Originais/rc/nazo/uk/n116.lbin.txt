This is a Laytangram.

To reveal the key, you must fit the five
pieces that make up the top hat into the
shape of the key, without overlapping the
pieces or leaving any empty space.

Can you do it?

You can flip the pieces if necessary.
!******************************!
Well done!

Now you've got the key, all you need is a
lock!
!******************************!
Too bad.

Try again.
!******************************!
Orientate {#3} vertically and place it
right at the tip of the key.
!******************************!
You need to place {#2} horizontally
in the tooth section of the key.

You can complete the key with or
without flipping {#0}, but its
position will change.
!******************************!
{#1} is not flipped.

Can you complete the puzzle now?
!******************************!
{#1} forms the base of the key's shaft.

Now you just need to get {#0} and {#4}
to fit together.
