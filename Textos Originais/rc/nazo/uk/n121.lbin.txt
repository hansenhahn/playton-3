The numbered plates Paillard ordered have
finally arrived! But wait a second...
Oh no! The manufacturer painted all the
numbers on backwards by mistake!

Paillard would like to use them as soon as
possible, but it will apparently take
quite a while to fix each and every plate.
To save time, the manufacturer would like
him to make do with the plates that he
can use as they are, and only send back
the ones that absolutely have to be fixed.
Paillard wants your help - tick only the
plates that can't be used.
!******************************!
You're number one!

6 and 9 definitely won't work.

0, 1 and 8 are symmetrical, so they're
clearly okay as they are. The 2 and the 5
can replace each other if they are
rotated 180 degrees. And rotating the 3,
4 and 7 as shown allows them to work just
fine!

Pretty nifty!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Are you sure you're using all the plates
that you can and only ticking the ones
that you absolutely cannot use?

Take another look and try again.
!******************************!
The 0 and 1 can be used as they are.
!******************************!
You can also use the 8 as it is.

Hmm... The 2 and 5 look really similar too.
!******************************!
The 4 will work just fine if you rotate
it 90 degrees.
!******************************!
Look closely at the 7, too. It will also
work if you rotate it.

Wow. Quite a few will work just fine as
they are. Some of them, however, simply
must be fixed, no matter how usable
they might look at first glance.
