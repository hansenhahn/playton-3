This photograph shows the surface of a
pond a few moments after somebody threw
in a handful of pebbles.

Assuming no pebbles landed in the exact
same spot, how many pebbles were thrown?
All the ripples captured in the photograph
came from pebbles.
!******************************!
A ripple of applause!

Six pebbles were thrown into the pond.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Try using the Memo Function to help you
work out where all the ripples are coming
from.
!******************************!
Ripples that have the same centre all
came from the same pebble, no matter
what size the ripples are.
!******************************!
Here's another way to think about
Hint 1: the number of pebbles thrown
into the pond is equal to the number of
centres.
!******************************!
If you think that only four pebbles
were thrown, take a closer look.

Have you noticed the largest ripple,
for example?
!******************************!
The largest ripple runs from top to
bottom through the middle of the
photograph. It's easy to mistake it for
a ripple coming from the pebble that
landed in the bottom-left corner, but in
fact it has a different centre.

Now, are there any more?
