This empty plot is lined with wooden stakes
that form a grid of squares. Your job is
to stretch some ropes between the
stakes so that a four-person family
planning to build a house here can have
four identically-shaped rooms, using up
the whole plot of land.

For a straight line across multiple stakes,
be sure to use only one rope. You need to
complete this puzzle using five ropes or
fewer.
!******************************!
Nice job!

There we are, all the same shape. Did it
take you long to realise that the rooms
didn't need to all be the same size?
!******************************!
Too bad!

Even if the shapes were similar,
maybe their angles were different,
or maybe they were not in proportion?
!******************************!
The plot is shaped like a square with
two of its corners cut off. Keep this
in mind and think about what kind of
shapes you can make four of.
!******************************!
You need four rooms of the same shape
to solve this puzzle. They don't all
have to be the same size, however!

Did you perhaps make four trapeziums
and wonder why you failed? Remember,
to truly be considered the same
shape, all the rooms need to be
to scale.
!******************************!
The solution involves two large rooms
of the same size and two small rooms
of the same size. The large rooms are
perfectly proportional to the small
ones.
!******************************!
Picture a cut diamond, the type that
you'd put in a ring, viewed from the
side. The four rooms are all that shape.

If that's still confusing, count two
stakes left from the top-right corner
and stretch a rope two stakes down
from there. Then count two stakes down
from the top-right corner and stretch
a rope two stakes left from there. See
the shape you made? That's it!
