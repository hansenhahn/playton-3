The pool needs to be filled up with water
before the kids can play in it, but all the
valves on the hosepipe that is connected
to the tank are shut tight.

Open just three valves to fill the pool
with water.
!******************************!
That's right!

Those are the three valves you need to
open. Now the kids can splash about
happily!
!******************************!
Bad luck.

Remember, you can only open three valves.

Starting from the tank, trace the route
that the water would take through the
hosepipe.
!******************************!
Of the three possible valves that the
water can pass through after the first
split in the hosepipe, the one you need
to open is either the middle one or the
bottom one!

!******************************!
After opening the correct valve of the
two mentioned in Hint 1, choose the
route that involves opening the bottom
valve!
!******************************!
Once you've opened the valves mentioned
in Hints 1 and 2, the rest is easy. Have
a look at the end part of the hosepipe.
As long as you don't choose a route
that contains a lot of valves, you'll
be fine.
!******************************!
After taking the route described in
Hints 1 and 2, the last valve you need
to open is the one in the bottom-left.
Opening this one should allow the water
to flow into the pool.

You've now opened three valves in total,
so the puzzle is complete.
