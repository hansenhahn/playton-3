This wooden board is oddly shaped and
difficult to work with.

The best solution would be to cut it
into two pieces that form a square when
they are combined.

However, the grain of the wood means
that the two pieces can't be flipped or
rotated after being cut.

Draw lines where the board needs to be
cut, then touch <CR>Submit</C>.
!******************************!
Sharp answer!

That wasn't too hard, was it?
!******************************!
Too bad!

The answer is actually rather simple.
Take another look and try again.
!******************************!
Compare the shape of your strange
wooden board to the square in the
top-right corner. Keep the number of
little squares along each side in mind.
That should give you a good place to
start.
!******************************!
Each side of the square you're trying
to make is five little squares. If you
bear that in mind, you should be able
to work out where to cut.
!******************************!
You may have noticed that you could
simply cut a straight line two rows
in from the right side and then flip
and rotate that piece to make it fit.
However, that's against the rules
because it would mess up the grain.

The cut you need to make looks like
some steps...
!******************************!
From the left edge of the empty square
in the bottom-right corner, cut up one
square, over to the left one square,
then up one more square. That's it!
