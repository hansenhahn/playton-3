This wooden board is oddly shaped and
difficult to work with.

The best solution would be to cut it into
two pieces that form a square when they
are combined.

However, the grain of the wood means
that the two pieces can't be flipped or
rotated after being cut.

Draw lines where the board needs to be
cut, then touch <CR>Submit</C>.
!******************************!
Sharp solution!

A rather interesting rearrangement, eh?
!******************************!
Too bad!

Focus on how you're going to fill that
three-square gap.
!******************************!
You don't need to make any cuts on the
left side of the board.
!******************************!
The gap is three squares long. In order
to fill it, you need to find a place from
which you can cut a piece of the same
shape.

Find a shape containing the protrusion
on the right that you can cut out to fill
this three-square gap.
!******************************!
You actually need to make two separate
cuts to get the correct piece: a short,
one-square line and a longer, four-
square line that turns twice.

Once you've made the correct cuts,
shift your piece one square up and
two squares to the left and it will
fit right in and make a square!
!******************************!
The top square of the L-shaped
protrusion will be included in the piece
that you cut out. Include the two
squares to the left of it in the part
you're cutting out as well. Now combine
those three squares with the other two
of the protruding L shape, and you will
get a five-square piece!
Finish cutting out this shape and you've
got the answer!
