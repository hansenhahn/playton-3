Two people, A and B, are discussing
the number of matchboxes on a table.
A is describing the matchboxes as
seen from above. B is describing them as
seen from the side, but we don't know
which side (front, back, left or right).

What is the maximum possible number of
matchboxes on the table?
!******************************!
Boxing clever!

21 matchboxes.
The above layout allows you to have the
maximum possible number of matchboxes.


!******************************!
Too bad.

Try to imagine looking at the matchboxes
from every direction: front, back, left
and right.
!******************************!
Take the layout that A described from
above and imagine that B is looking at it
from the right-hand side.
Working from left to right in B's
description, each row of matchboxes
would contain a maximum of:
2 piles x 2 layers
3 piles x 3 layers
3 piles x 1 layer
2 piles x 2 layers
So the maximum possible number of
matchboxes in this case would be 20.
!******************************!
Now take A's layout and imagine that
B is looking at it from the bottom
of A's top-down description.
Working from left to right in B's
description, each row of matchboxes
would contain a maximum of:
3 piles x 2 layers
1 pile x 3 layers
2 piles x 1 layer
4 piles x 2 layers
So the maximum possible number of
matchboxes in this case would be 19.
!******************************!
Thirdly, take A's layout and imagine that
B is looking at it from the left.
Working from left to right in B's
description, each row of matchboxes
would contain a maximum of:
2 piles x 2 layers
3 piles x 3 layers
3 piles x 1 layer
2 piles x 2 layers
So the maximum possible number of
matchboxes in this case would be 20.
!******************************!
Finally, take the layout that A described
from above and imagine that B is looking
at it from the top of A's top-down
description.
Add up the number of matchboxes as
shown in Hints 1-3. If this number is
higher than 20, you know it's your
answer.

Now all you have to do is count the
matchboxes.
