You placed three identical paper cups on
the table as shown in the top-left image
and secretly marked the middle one as
shown by the small blue arrow.

You then closed your eyes and told a
friend: {''}Hide a coin under one of these
cups and then switch the places of the
other two.{''}

When you opened your eyes, the cups were
rearranged as shown below. Which one has
the coin hidden under it, A, B or C?
!******************************!
Yeah!

The coin is under cup A!

Since the marked cup in the middle moved
to the right to become cup C, you know
that it switched places with the cup that
was there originally, cup B.

The cup that your friend hid the coin
under didn't move, so you know it must
be cup A!
!******************************!
Too bad!

There's nothing confusing about this
puzzle if you just think things through...
!******************************!
Which cup didn't move?
!******************************!
The marked cup moved.
!******************************!
The marked cup moved from the middle
over to the right.
!******************************!
The marked cup started in the middle
and switched places with the cup on
the right.

So where's the coin?
