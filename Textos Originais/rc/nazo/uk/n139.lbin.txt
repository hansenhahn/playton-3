Six frogs are sitting on logs.
Get them hopping around so that each
frog is on a log with a ribbon that
matches its own colour.
Here are three rules you'll need to follow:

1. Frogs can hop to any empty, adjacent
log.
2. Frogs can leap over an adjacent frog
to reach an empty log.
3. Frogs can't leap over two frogs at a
time.

Now get those frogs hopping!
!******************************!
Hip, hop- huh?!

Where have they gone?

They must be preparing for the
frog-cappella!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Try again.
!******************************!
Don't overthink it.

This puzzle isn't too tricky if you just
relax and keep those frogs hopping
around. It's fun, isn't it? Boing boing!

Don't even worry about the other hints.
Just keep leaping!
!******************************!
This puzzle can be solved in as few as
15 moves. Here are the first four:

Red, yellow, white, red...
