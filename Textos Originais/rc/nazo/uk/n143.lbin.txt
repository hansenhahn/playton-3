{''}10 close brothers and sisters live
together. Now Luke, let's imagine that
you're the eighth child.
The oldest daughter is the second son's
younger sister and the third son's older
sister. The fourth son is the second
daughter's older brother and the oldest
daughter's younger brother. There are no
boys in between the third and fourth
daughters.
Is the third child from the bottom a boy
or a girl?{''}
{''}I can't tell just from this!{''}
Let's tell Luke the answer in secret.
!******************************!
That's right!

It's a boy.

{''}I told you at the beginning, Luke:
{''}Let's imagine that you're the eighth
child.{''}

My question was asking about the third
child from the bottom, or in other words,
the eighth oldest child. That eighth
child was you, Luke, and I know better
than anyone that you're a boy!{''}
!******************************!
Too bad.

Try to think of things as simply
as possible.
!******************************!
You weren't confounded by that 
roundabout explanation, were you?
Read the puzzle again from the very
beginning.
!******************************!
Is reading all the conditions of the
puzzle proving too much of a pain?

If you've started thinking that way,
then you should know that this is a
VERY simple puzzle!
!******************************!
Out of the 10 brothers and sisters,
Luke is the eighth child {''}from the top{''}.

If this is the first condition of
the puzzle, then...
!******************************!
Out of 10 brothers and sisters, third
from the bottom is eighth from the top.

Luke certainly isn't a girl...

{''}I think you know the answer now, Luke!{''}
