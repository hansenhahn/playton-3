You want to pave your garden using one
of these five types of paving stones.
However, only one of these shapes will,
when used repeatedly, cover every part
of the garden apart from the
star-shaped flower pots.

The paving stone shapes can be rotated,
but not flipped.

Which type of paving stone should you
use? 


!******************************!
Well done!

E is the paving stone you need to use, as
you can see above. Being able to make
good use of stones is a useful skill for
a gardener.
!******************************!
Too bad.

Maybe landscape gardening is harder than
it looks...
!******************************!
Start laying the stones at the corners.
There are some types that won't fit
into every corner, no matter how much
you rotate them.
!******************************!
No matter how you try to lay paving
stone C, you can only fit three of them
in the garden, and there will always be
one space left over.

C cannot therefore be the answer.
!******************************!
D's got a rather unique shape, so you
can't fit more than two of those paving
stones in the garden.

D is therefore out of the question as
well.
!******************************!
The answer is one of A, B or E.

As mentioned in Hint 1, if you start
laying the stones at the corners of the
garden, you'll soon find out which
shapes don't fit.

You can't fit more than four of any
of the stones into the garden.
