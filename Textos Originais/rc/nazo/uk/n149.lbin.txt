Here are three strange symbols: A, B and C.

If A is 63 and B is 89, what on earth could
C be?

You can take it for granted that C will be
a two-digit number as well.
!******************************!
Correct!

The answer is 52.

When the symbols are rotated 90 degrees
clockwise and a line is drawn down the
middle, they appear as 63, 89 and 52.
!******************************!
Bad luck.

Try looking at the symbols from a bit
further away.
!******************************!
Think about the relationship between
the symbols and the numbers.

Try using the Memo Function to write
down the numbers. You'll need to write
them in quite an angular way.

!******************************!
Try tilting your head a little to the
left and look at the symbols again.

Can you see anything?
!******************************!
Use the Memo Function to colour in the
cavities in each symbol. When you've
finished colouring, use the eraser to
rub out a straight horizontal line
through the middle of the symbols.

Are you seeing it now?
!******************************!
Okay, here comes the big hint:

After following the instructions in Hint
3, try looking at the symbols from the
right-hand side of the screen.

Can you see some digital-clock style
numbers?
