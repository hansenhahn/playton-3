Two sisters are talking.
{''}One year ago, my age was exactly half
your age{''}, says the younger sister.
The older sister replies: {''}Even one year
from now, your age will be half my age.
Here, look, if we split the numbers into
two parts, top and bottom, they both give
your age in a year's time.{''}
{''}Wow, you're right!{''}

How old is the younger sister now?
!******************************!
That's right!

The younger sister is currently 9 and the
older sister is 17.

One year ago, the older sister was 16 and
the younger sister was 8, half her
sister's age. One year from now, the older
sister will be 18 and the younger sister
will be 10. Splitting 18 horizontally gives
you 10 twice.
!******************************!
Too bad.

Don't think too hard - try changing
your way of thinking instead.
!******************************!
You don't need to worry about how old
the sisters were a year ago. The
important point is their age a year
from now. What does {''}split the
numbers into two parts{''} mean?
!******************************!
Have you worked out what {''}split the
numbers into two parts, top and bottom{''}
means?

Think about the numbers 0-9. Of these,
the only ones that retain a numerical
meaning even when they're cut in half
are 1 and 8.
!******************************!
If the older sister were 1 year old
next year, the younger sister would
also be 1, so that can't be right.

If the older sister were 8 in a year's
time, the younger sister would be 0,
so that's wrong as well.

Thinking about it this way, it's also
plain to see that it wouldn't work if
the older sister were 81 or 88 either.
!******************************!
From Hint 3, you know that the older
sister will be either 11 or 18 in a year's
time. Splitting 11 into two parts, top and
bottom, gives you 11, which doesn't fulfil
the conditions. The only remaining
possibility is that the older sister
will be 18 in a year's time.

All you've got to do now is work out
the sisters' current ages.
