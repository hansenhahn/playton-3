Three different types of tinned food
are randomly stacked up. You need to
rearrange them into stacks of the same
food.

However, if there are tins on top of the
tin you want to move, you have to move
them all at once. Also, you can't have
more than six tins in a stack.

Sounds easy, right? Oh...one more thing:
you have to do it in six moves or fewer.
!******************************!
Stacktacular!

Now everything is in order. Nice!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Try again.
!******************************!
If you plan your moves carefully, it
shouldn't be too hard.

Here's a clue to get you started:

Your first move involves moving two tins
at the same time.
!******************************!
For example, grab the tin of peaches
from the middle stack and move it
over to the left.

There's just a single tin of fish in the
middle now. Hmm... Well, why not move the
tin of fish from the right stack onto
the one in the middle?
!******************************!
Continuing from Hint 2, if you grab the
tin of fish from the left stack and move
it onto the two you've got stacked in
the middle, then you'll have all three
tins of fish stacked together. Nice!

Now then, what's next?
!******************************!
Continuing from Hint 3, move the tin of
cherries from the right stack to the
left stack. Now move the cherries from
the middle stack to the left stack.

Almost there now. You can do it!
