The black top hat below is made from six
pieces. Using the same pieces, make a
white top hat in the same spot!

The pieces must be moved and rotated,
but you can't flip them over.
!******************************!
Smooth!

What an elegant white top hat!
!******************************!
Too bad!

That's not really the shape of a top hat...
!******************************!
This puzzle might look familiar, but
you can't flip these pieces over.

Start by thinking about what a
{''}white top hat{''} looks like.
!******************************!
If you move all the pieces outside the
frame, the frame itself becomes a white
top hat! See how that works?

Now all you have to do is arrange the
pieces around the hat to frame it.
!******************************!
So you know what you need to do, but
you don't know how to do it? Well,
not to worry. Here's a hint:

You can fit the two pieces with two
bends around either end of the hat's
brim.
!******************************!
The short piece with two bends goes
around the left side of the brim.

The long piece with two bends goes
around the right side of the brim.

The rest should be no problem now!
