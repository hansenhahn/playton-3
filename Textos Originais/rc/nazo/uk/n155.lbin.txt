Somebody tore this calendar page in half!
How rude! But the puzzle must go on.

When added together, the four circled
days equal 20. The smallest of the four
numbers is one. 

Assuming you had the entire calendar page
to work with and you circled a square
of four numbers that added up to 88,
what would the smallest of those four
numbers be?
!******************************!
Ding ding!

Eighteen is correct! If you look closely
at a calendar, you'll see some numerical
patterns. Numbers to the left or right of
each other differ by one. Numbers above
or below one another differ by seven.
In a square of four numbers, the bottom
row total and top row total will have a
difference of 14 between them.
So, if the sum of four numbers in a square
is 88, the upper two must equal 44 - 7,
or 37. And those two must differ by one,
so they're 19 and the answer, 18!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Don't go too crazy trying to add up every
possible combination of four numbers that
equals 88. Instead, try to be efficient
in your thought process.

Are you trying to reproduce the entire
calendar page on a piece of paper?

You could find the answer that way,
but there might be an easier method...
!******************************!
This is a calendar page, so there is a
specific order to the way the numbers
are arranged. If you can find a pattern
between the numbers next to each other
and above and below one another, you
might discover an interesting way of
solving this puzzle.
!******************************!
On a calendar, numbers to the left and
right of each other differ by one.
Numbers above and below each other
differ by seven.

Using this pattern, there's a relatively
simple calculation you can use to solve
this puzzle.
!******************************!
In the square of numbers you're looking
for, the bottom-right one is 26.
