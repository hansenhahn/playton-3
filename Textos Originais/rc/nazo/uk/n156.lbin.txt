There are 52 cards in the deck below,
26 black and 26 red. No jokers.

After shuffling the deck and randomly
cutting it in half, you count 23 cards
in the stack on the left.

So, what's the difference between the
number of red cards in the left stack
and the number of black cards in the
right stack?
!******************************!
You aced it!

There will always be three more black
cards in the stack on the right than
there are red cards in the stack on
the left.

You can use an equation to solve this
puzzle, but it's also fun to just try
some random numbers and work it out that
way. Once you start noticing that there's
a consistent difference no matter what
numbers you choose, it's really exciting!
!******************************!
Too bad!

It's clear that this is a maths problem
of sorts, but it's hard to work out
what you're supposed to calculate.

Experiment with some numbers and you
might notice something...
!******************************!
Don't let the fact that this is a
number problem confuse you.

You should be able to work out the
answer using simple arithmetic if you
know what to look for.
!******************************!
The quickest way is to come up with
trial numbers.

There are 23 cards in the left-hand
stack. Since there are 52 cards in a
deck, that means 29 cards in the other
stack.

Now imagine that the left-hand stack is
made up of 10 red cards and 13 black
cards. How many cards of each colour
remain in the right-hand stack?
!******************************!
After following Hint 2, you can work
out the colour of the cards in the
right-hand stack based on how many red
and black cards are in the left stack.
Subtract 10 from 26 and you get 16 red
cards. Then take 13 from 26 and you get
13 black cards.
You now know the difference between
the number of red cards in the left
stack and black cards in the right!
Now try a different set of numbers and
see what you get.
!******************************!
Keep trying out different numbers.
If the left stack has five red cards
and 18 black, the right stack will
have 21 red cards and eight black.

Now compare this result with the one
from Hint 3. Look at that! The
difference is the same no matter
how many of each colour there are!
