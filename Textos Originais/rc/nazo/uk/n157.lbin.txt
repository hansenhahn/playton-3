You found a nice circular patch of soil
that you'd like to divide up into as
many separate plots as possible.

You have five ropes to work with. Each
one must be stretched in a straight line
across the patch, and they can cross
each other as often as you like.

Using only these five ropes, what is the
maximum number of sections you can divide
the patch of soil into?
!******************************!
Excellent!

You can divide the patch of soil into as
many as 16 different sections!

The first rope divides the circular patch
into two sections. The second rope divides
it into four. The third rope crosses the
first two and divides the patch into seven
sections. Once you've used all five ropes
like this, you end up with 16 sections!

In other words, you form a star in the
centre of the patch, as above.
!******************************!
Too bad!

The sections can all be different sizes.
The important thing is to divide the patch
into the maximum number of plots.
!******************************!
Five ropes could only create six
sections if they weren't allowed to
cross.

But the ropes are allowed to cross
each other, so you can create a lot
more sections.
!******************************!
If you stretch two ropes across the
patch so that they cross in the middle,
you'll divide the patch into four
different sections. And that's using
just two of your five ropes!
!******************************!
With your five ropes, you can divide
the patch of soil into more than 10
different sections.
!******************************!
Use the Memo Function to draw a star
in the middle of the circle, using five
straight lines. Make sure the points
of the star are well within the circle
and the lines creating each point
extend out into the grass so they
also create plots between the circle's
circumference and the outside of the
star.

Now count each section. Well, how many
are there?
