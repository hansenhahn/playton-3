Four different types of tinned food
are randomly stacked up. You need to
rearrange them into stacks of the same
food.

However, if there are tins on top of the
tin you want to move, you have to move
them all at once. Also, you can't have
more than six tins in a stack.

Not too hard, right? Oh...one more thing:
you have to do it in 14 moves or fewer.
!******************************!
Beautiful!

How many moves did it take?
!******************************!
Too bad!

Try again.
!******************************!
There are several ways to solve this
puzzle, so start moving those tins
around and see how it goes.

It shouldn't be too hard to get to a
point where a few more moves will do it.
!******************************!
The 14-move limit definitely complicates
matters. Don't forget that you can't
stack up more than six tins at a time.

Don't get carried away stacking up the
same type of tin at every opportunity.
It will cost you moves in the long run.
!******************************!
Instead of stacking up the same type of
tin every chance you get, it's better
to think about what type of tin you
should stack in each row.

Whenever possible, you want to move
as many tins as you can together. Of
course, sometimes you have to move
just one tin at a time.
!******************************!
From left to right, think of the stacks
as the first, second, third and fourth.

Move the fish from the fourth stack to
the first stack. Move the peaches from
the second stack to the fourth stack.
Move the ham from the third stack to
the second stack. Move the fish from
the third stack to the first stack...

You can take it from here!
