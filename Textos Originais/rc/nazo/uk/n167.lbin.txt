You have three identical bracelets that
you'd like to make into one big necklace.

Rearrange the tiles below to connect all
the bracelet pieces in one continuous
loop.
!******************************!
Skilfully done!

Hopefully it's not too long to wear!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Try again.
!******************************!
Before you start moving things around
willy-nilly, think about what kind of
large loop shape you can make with the
pieces available.
!******************************!
Combine the bracelets into the shape of
a large plus sign (+).
!******************************!
The three blank tiles and one empty
square go in the four corners when
the necklace is complete.

Even the shortest solution takes quite
a few moves, so keep at it and don't
give up!
!******************************!
Try using the Memo Function to sketch
out where each type of tile will go when
the necklace is complete. Once you've
worked that out, it shouldn't take you 
too long to manoeuvre the tiles into
place.
