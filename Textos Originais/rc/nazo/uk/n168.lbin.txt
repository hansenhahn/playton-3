This is the time machine's ignition
mechanism! In order to prevent accidents,
a complicated security procedure has
been incorporated.

To start the time machine, assemble the
blocks into a square. Make sure that the
red orb is at the centre, in its original
position.
!******************************!
Stellar!

The time machine is ready to go!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Try again.
!******************************!
Think about how the blocks will fit
together to make a square before you
start moving them around. You won't
get very far if you don't plan ahead.
!******************************!
Use the Memo Function to work out the
correct position for each block. There
are four small L-shaped blocks. Three of
them form corners of the square.
!******************************!
The T-shaped block goes on the right
side of the square, slotted into two
small L-shaped blocks.

The S-shaped block goes in the middle,
sitting on the red orb.
!******************************!
The small L-shaped block in the
bottom-left goes one square above its
starting position. The large L-shaped
block goes directly below it, forming the
bottom-left corner of the square.
