The seller of a large farm has demanded
that a prospective buyer also purchase
all the cows and chickens currently
living on the land or the deal is off!

{''}There are 30 animals on my farm.{''}

{''}But...how many of each are there?{''}

{''}Well, there are 100 legs. What a bargain,
right? Do we have a deal?{''}

All the animals are healthy and have all
their legs. How many cows are there?
!******************************!
Exactly!

There are 20 cows living on the farm.

20 cows with four legs each equals 80
legs. 10 chickens with two legs each
equals 20 legs. Together, that's a total
of 30 animals and 100 legs!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Don't let this sneaky seller fool you!
!******************************!
You know there are 100 legs in total,
so start from there. Try different
combinations of numbers and see what
you end up with.

Say there are 15 cows and 15 chickens.
That's 15 times four legs for the cows
and 15 times two legs for the chickens.
That gives you 30 animals and 90 legs.
Close, but not quite 100. Now give it
a try yourself and see if you can work
out the answer!
