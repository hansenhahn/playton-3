This king's crown contains a number of
jewels of the following types: diamond,
emerald and sapphire.

There are more than twice as many
diamonds as there are emeralds. The
number of sapphires is less than half
the number of emeralds.

What is the minimum number of jewels in
the king's crown?
!******************************!
Glittering!

The answer is 11 jewels.

If there were only one or two emeralds,
then the number of sapphires would not
fit the puzzle conditions. The minimum
number of emeralds is therefore three,
meaning that there's one sapphire.
From that, you know that the minimum
number of diamonds is seven.
!******************************!
Oh dear.

I wonder how much a crown like this
would cost to buy...

{''}The number of sapphires is less than

you gather from this information?

There's at least one of each type of
jewel, remember.
