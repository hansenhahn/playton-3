An exclusive three-year private school
has admitted only 100 new students a year
since its inception three years ago.

Starting from year four, the school plans
to admit 10 more new students each year
than it did the previous year.

In what year of operation will the school's
population first exceed 400 students?

You can assume that no students will drop
out, change schools or leave early.
!******************************!
Well done!

The school's population will exceed 400
students in year eight.

Every year from year four onwards, the
number of new recruits will increase by 10,
but the students who started three
years earlier will finish school and leave.
In years four, five and six, the population
will increase by 10, 20 and then 30
students a year. After that, the
population will increase steadily by
30 students a year.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think about it carefully and try again.
!******************************!
When calculating the school's total
population, don't forget that students
stay at the school for three years.

In its fourth year, the school will have
10 more students overall than the
previous year. In the fifth year, it will
have 20 more than that and in the sixth,
it will have 30 more.

Each year thereafter, the number of
students will grow by 30 per year.
