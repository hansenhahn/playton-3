Three books have been placed on a table.
Someone looking at the books from a
certain direction commented:
{''}That reminds me of Professor Layton.{''}

From which direction was this person
looking at the books?

Touch a letter, A to D, to select a
direction.
!******************************!
That's right!

Direction D.

From that direction the books look like
Layton's top hat!
!******************************!
Too bad.

Isn't there a familiar shape to be found
somewhere on the table?
!******************************!
When the person said it reminded them
of Professor Layton, what did they
mean?

Professor Layton is an English
gentleman. What's the first thing that
comes to mind when you think of English
gentlemen?
