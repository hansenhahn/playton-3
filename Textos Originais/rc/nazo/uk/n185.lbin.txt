This is a jelly mould.

After pouring in the liquid jelly and
letting it set in the fridge, you turn out
the mould and get a solid shape of jelly.

Which one of the jelly shapes, A to D, is
the shape produced by your mould?
!******************************!
That's right!

The answer is shape D.
When the jelly is turned out of the mould,
right and left are reversed, as well
as the indentation.

Since the colour of the jelly depends on
the ingredients, it is irrelevant to this
puzzle.
!******************************!
Too bad.

Think about what you're looking at.
!******************************!
What will the jelly look like when it's
removed from the mould?

Look at the details on the jelly shapes
and try to reverse your way of
thinking.
