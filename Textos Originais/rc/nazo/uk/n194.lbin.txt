A frog is sitting on a long, thin stick.
This frog can only move by hopping 70 cm
or 30 cm at a time. In order to move 10 cm
down the stick in the lowest possible
number of hops, the frog must hop 70 cm
forwards and then make two 30 cm hops
backwards.

Using this method, which of the distances
marked on the stick, from 20 cm to 100 cm,
will require the most hops to reach?

Touch <CR>Input Answer</C>, then enter a
number as your answer.
!******************************!
Top of the hops!

The answer is 50 cm.

The frog will have to hop five times to
reach that point on the stick.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Try working out how many hops it would
take the frog to reach each of the
remaining nine marked distances.
!******************************!
There's no special trick to working
this one out, so you'll just have to
knuckle down and think about each one
of the distances individually.

Just bear in mind that there might be a
more efficient way to reach a distance
than you realise at first.
