{''}I went skiing last weekend and saw such a
delicate beauty, I simply had to get my
sketchbook out{''}, said one artist to his
friend. {''}Look! Exquisite, don't you think?{''}

The friend pointed to the drawing and
replied: {''}Er... Well, I'd hardly describe that
nose as delicate, but...nice drawing, 
anyway.{''}

What is the friend talking about? Circle
the spot on the sketch and touch <CR>Submit</C>.
!******************************!
You hit it on the nose!

Depending on how you look at it, the
sketch can resemble either a young
woman or a portly middle-aged man!

What the friend thought was a giant
nose is actually the woman's hair.
!******************************!
Too bad!

The friend is looking at the drawing in
a different way from the artist.

Shift your perspective and see if you can
work out what he's talking about.
!******************************!
If the sketch was in colour, there
would be no mistaking the woman.

Look for a slightly pudgy chap with a
moustache in the sketch. Then look for
his nose...
