The cave ceiling suddenly collapsed
during your caving expedition and now
you're trapped underground!

To escape, make your way through the
blocks and reach the exit, marked by
the white arrow at the surface.

The orange ball is you. Good luck!
!******************************!
You made it!

Phew! That was a close one.
!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
The two square blocks near the exit
are a real nuisance, aren't they?

Line those two up along the bottom and
you'll be out in no time!
