From each top letter, follow the vertical
line down, and turn to follow the first
horizontal line you reach. Then continue
downwards, turning 90 degrees at every 
intersection you meet.

This map is meant to connect each top
letter to its matching bottom letter when
followed as described above. However, it
contains two mistakes. To make it work,
two horizontal lines must be removed.
Touch those two lines to mark them with
an X, then touch <CR>Submit</C>.
!******************************!
Perfect!

The map now works just as designed.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Remember, only two horizontal lines need
to be removed for the map to work.
!******************************!
The two horizontal lines between letters
B and C are fine as they are.

That should make things a lot easier!
