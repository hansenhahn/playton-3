Oh goodness! A precious garnet has fallen
to the bottom of a very cluttered case.

Can you get the garnet to the opening at
the top of the briefcase by sliding the
clutter out of the way?
!******************************!
Great job!

What a beautiful gemstone!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Try again.
!******************************!
Don't let the clutter get the better of
you. As long as you keep creating space
and avoid making the same moves over
and over, you should be able to work
the garnet to the top.
