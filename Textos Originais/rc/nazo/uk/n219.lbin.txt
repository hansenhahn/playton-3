Oh no! You're trapped deep underground!
To escape, make your way past the blocks
and reach the surface. The exit is marked
by the white arrow.

The orange ball at the bottom is you.

Good luck!
!******************************!
You're free!

This type of puzzle often remains just 
as hard to solve no matter how many 
times you do it!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Try again.
!******************************!
This puzzle is difficult, but it can be
solved in as few as 10 moves.

Find a way to slide the blue block into
the square space on the right. Then
slide the yellow block into the crook of
the blue block. After that, slide the
orange block around the end of the
yellow block.

That should help you escape!
