Make your way from the start to the goal,
but be wary of banana skins. Whenever you
step on one, you'll slide without stopping
until you hit a wall!

Can you find a solid route through
these slippery streets?

Touch a red arrow to move in that
direction.

Fruitastic!
 
Here's something you might not know about
bananas: they are one of the fruits
that keep ripening even after they're
picked. This means that they're green
when they're picked. You wouldn't want
to eat a green one, though. It probably
wouldn't be very nice.

Too bad!

Try it again.

It might seem obvious, but you can't go
straight at the first junction.
!******************************!
[ef0b01000e000000:027e020000]
Go down at the first junction and take
a left at the next one.

Now go for a slide!

Continuing from Hint 2, once you've slid
into the far-left wall, go down and
slide into the bottom wall. Then take a
right and walk until you slide again!
!******************************!
[f10b010010000000:026d030000]
Continuing from Hint 3, at the
bottom-right junction walk back to the
left until just before you run into a
banana skin. Now go up and slide to the
top.

The slippery part of your trip is over.
Now it's just a short walk to the goal!
