In order to open the cage, you'll need
to decide which button to push.
The rules are simple. Think of the buttons
as squares. Each symbol indicates a
direction and you proceed from square to
square following these directions:
Star = left
Moon = right
Sun = down
Water = up
There is one square you can start from
which allows you to pass through every
square exactly once. Touch that square.

Well done!

Apart from the last square itself, all
squares form a single path leading to the
last square. Once you realise this, it's
easy to find the starting square.

Oh dear.

Are you sure you haven't made a mistake
somewhere?

This is the type of puzzle for which the
Memo Function comes in really handy. It's
difficult to visualise the directions
using only the symbols, so try drawing
an arrow in each square to make things
easier.

Try choosing a square at random and
starting from there. Use the Memo
Function to write an arrow on each
square and trace your path.

You've followed the advice given in
Hint 2 but just went around in little
circles? That must mean you started in
one of the top-left squares.

Those squares are actually the last
ones on the path.

[f10b010010000000:0297040000]
From Hint 3 you know the last squares
on the path. Now think carefully and
proceed backwards from here.

The starting square is one of the five
Star squares.
