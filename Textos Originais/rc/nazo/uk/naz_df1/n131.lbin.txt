There are three siblings: A, B and C.

A: {''}I have one older brother and three
younger sisters.{''}

B: {''}I have two older brothers and two
younger sisters.{''}

C: {''}I have three older brothers and one
younger sister.{''}

Given that all their statements are true,
what is the lowest possible number of
siblings in this family?
!******************************!
[ec0b01000b000000:0260010000]
Bang on!

The lowest possible number of siblings is
six.

At first glance, it might seem like there
are only five. But the fact that A says
that he has three younger sisters means
there must be at least three female
siblings. Likewise, the fact that C says
that she has three older brothers means
there must also be at least three male
siblings, so five siblings isn't quite
enough.

Too bad!

Remember that you want to find the
minimum number of siblings.

[ee0b01000d000000:0228030000]
Think about A, B and C.

Who's the oldest? Who's the youngest?
!******************************!
[ef0b01000e000000:0267030000]
You know that A is the oldest, followed
by B and then C.

A also has an older brother.

C also has a younger sister.

Try making a diagram based on the
conditions mentioned in Hint 2, and note
the genders of each known sibling.
You should realise something important.

Also, just so you're clear, A is male
and B is female.
!******************************!
[f10b010010000000:02aa040000]
There are more than five siblings.

If A has three younger sisters and
C has three older brothers, then
there must be at least three female
siblings and three male siblings.
