The numbers 1, 2 and 5 shown here look
exactly the same when they are flipped
upside down.

You have two cards with 1 on them, four
cards with 2 on them, and one card with 5
on it. Use the cards to create an
equation that is also valid when flipped
upside down.

That's right!

21 x 12 = 252

or

12 x 21 = 252

Too bad!

Are you finding the maths taxing?

Would it help if you knew what went in
the slots that form the answer to the
equation?

Well, it's 252. Now, with a little bit of
calculation the puzzle is solved!
