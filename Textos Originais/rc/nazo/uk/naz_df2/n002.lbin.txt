Below is the map to the clock shop that
accompanied the letter from Luke's
future self. Starting from the yellow
arrow, can you find the clock shop using
the times listed on the map?

Circle the letter of the correct building
and touch <CR>Submit</C>.

Good timing!

The answer is H. The times indicate which
direction to go at each junction, and are
written in order.

At each junction, you need to check the
listed time and proceed in the direction a
clock's hour hand would point.

Too bad!

The times listed are clues for how to get
to the shop.

Try thinking about it again.

To work out the route to the shop,
you need to know where to turn, and
in which direction...
!******************************!
[ef0b01000e000000:02b0020000]
Imagine the listed times being displayed 
on an analogue clock. The minute hand is
always pointing straight up, but the
hour hand points in various directions...
!******************************!

If you're having trouble, you might be
trying to imagine yourself inside the
map and working out the directions from
there.

Try looking at the map as you would a
clock on a wall, then use the Memo
Function to draw the direction of the
hour hand directly onto the map.
!******************************!
[f10b010010000000:025f040000]
For each time listed, move in the
direction the hour hand would point
on an analogue clock.

The first time listed is 12:00, so keep
going north at the first junction you
come to. The next time is 03:00, so
you've got to head east at the second
junction. You can work out the rest
from here.
