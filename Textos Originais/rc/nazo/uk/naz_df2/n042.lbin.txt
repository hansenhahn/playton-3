Can you make a roll to these exact
specifications?

{.} The ham goes above the potato salad.
{.} The only ingredient between the ham and
tomato is lettuce.
{.} The cheese touches the bread.
{.} The middle layer is neither ham nor
lettuce.

Drag the ingredients to their correct
positions and touch <CR>Submit</C>.

When trying to stack the ingredients as
the rules dictate, are you finding that
either the ham or the lettuce always
seems to end up in the middle?

The trick is to work out where the ham
goes.
!******************************!
[ef0b01000e000000:0257020000]
The ham goes either at the very top or
very bottom.
!******************************!
[f00b01000f000000:028b020000]
The cheese goes at the very bottom.
!******************************!
[f10b010010000000:02af020000]
The cheese goes on the bottom, to be
next to the bread, and the ham goes at
the top.

Since the lettuce has to go between the
ham and tomato, the order from the top
down is ham, lettuce, then tomato.

With the cheese at the very bottom, the
roll is basically done.
