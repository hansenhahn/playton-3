In this dark maze of tunnels, you can't
turn unless you hit a wall. Starting at
the red dot and following this rule,
you need to reach the exit without
taking the same path twice or running
into any dead ends.

Which route should you take? Draw a
line to plan your escape!

Great escape!

You found the way out!
!******************************!
[ed0b01000c000000:0248010000]
Too bad!

Remember, you can only turn when you
hit a wall.

There are three directions in which
you can go from the start point.
Try each one and see where you end up.

Watch out for dead ends!

It might look confusing at first because
there are so many junctions, but if you
eliminate all the routes that contain
dead ends, you should soon find the
answer.

The correct route is not the one that
goes up from the start point.
!******************************!
[f10b010010000000:02f0020000]
The route that goes right from the
start point isn't the correct one
either. Head down to make your escape!
