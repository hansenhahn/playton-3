A friend of yours loves plasters. He simply
adores them! He wears them all the time,
whether he's injured or not.

As usual, he's got a load of them stuck all
over his face. But today, he's made a
puzzle out of them just for you!

{''}Which one did I stick on first?{''}

Touch the correct plaster to mark it with
an X, then touch <CR>Submit</C>.

Great eye!

The plaster he stuck on first should be
beneath all the rest. If you look closely,
you'll see that there's only one plaster
that doesn't overlap any of the others.

Too bad!

Look closely at all the plasters
before submitting your answer.

The first plaster he stuck on should
be underneath all the others.
