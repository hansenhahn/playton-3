Your bus journey to work takes one hour.
You work for two hours, then take the
bus home from the bus stop next to where
you work. The bus timetables to and from
work are shown below.

You want to make the time between getting
on the bus to work and getting off the
bus from work as short as possible. Which
bus should you take to work in order to
achieve this?

Touch the letter next to the departure
time of this bus.

That's right!

Taking the midnight bus to work and
catching the first bus back in the 
morning will take the least amount of
time overall.

Bad luck!

Making some notes on the bus timetable
might help you work it out.

You can choose any bus you like to get
to work, but you have to take the first
bus that leaves after you finish work in
order to get back as quickly as possible.

Remember to take this into consideration.

For example, suppose that there is a
bus at 12:30. If you took this bus you
would get to work at 13:30. By the time
you finished work it'd be 15:30. 

Work out what time you'd finish work for
each bus on the timetable this way.

Forget any preconceived notions you
might have about what time work starts.

You can work at any time you like.

Don't rule out working at night and
going home in the morning...
