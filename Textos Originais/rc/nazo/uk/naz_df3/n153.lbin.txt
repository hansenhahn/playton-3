The green frame and six orange blocks
below are all composed of identical
equilateral triangles.

The frame can be completely filled using
five of the six blocks. The blocks can
be freely rotated and flipped to fit into
the frame.

Circle the one block that isn't used!

Excellent!

Was it difficult to assemble in your head?
There's actually a really easy way to
solve this puzzle. Did you find it?

The frame is composed of 22 identical
equilateral triangles. The six blocks
together are composed of 24 triangles,
which is two too many. This means the
unused block must be the one made from
only two triangles!

[ed0b01000c000000:0275020000]
Too bad!

Have you tried counting all the triangles?
!******************************!
[ee0b01000d000000:02aa020000]
Don't be confused by the complex
shapes of the blocks. Try comparing
the frame and the blocks from a
different perspective.

Filling the frame with the five correct
shapes can be pretty tricky, but
there's a way to identify the surplus
block without worrying about the shapes
at all!

[f00b01000f000000:02c5030000]
The frame and the blocks are all
composed of identical equilateral
triangles.

If you compare the number of triangles
in the frame to the number of triangles
used to create all six blocks, then...
!******************************!
[f10b010010000000:028a040000]
The frame is composed of 22 triangles.

Together, the six blocks are composed
of 24 triangles.

So there are two too many triangles in
the blocks. Which means...?
