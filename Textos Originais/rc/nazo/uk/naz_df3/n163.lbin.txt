Manoeuvre the three coloured blocks into
the matching goal squares on the board.
All three blocks must be in place at
the same time to complete this puzzle.

To move the blocks, rotate the board
90 degrees clockwise or anticlockwise
by touching the arrow buttons below.

Wahey!

Did that make your head spin?

[ed0b01000c000000:0245010000]
Too bad!

Try again.

If you just keep rotating the board,
you'll solve it eventually, right?

Actually, no. If you don't plan ahead,
you can get stuck. But if you do think
ahead, it's much easier than you might
expect!

If you're not careful, a block might get
trapped somewhere and make the puzzle
impossible to solve. If you think you're
completely stuck, just restart the
puzzle.

The trap you need to avoid is the nook
next to the red goal square. If a block
ends up in there, you'll have to start
the puzzle from scratch.

Don't try to move the blocks out of
their starting places all at once.

Instead, try moving them to the other
side of the board one at a time. If you
can work out how to do that, the rest
shouldn't be too hard.
