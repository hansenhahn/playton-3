The floor below is made up of 24 tiles. It's
specially designed so that the tiles will
fall away in a path, one by one, until
they're all gone.

Once the first tile falls, an adjacent tile
falls, then one next to that and so on,
following this order of suits: hearts,
spades, diamonds, clubs. The first tile to
fall, however, is not necessarily a heart.

If you can find the tile that will fall last,
you can stop this floor from disappearing!
Touch the last tile and then touch <CR>Submit</C>.

Bingo!

Very impressive work!
!******************************!
[ed0b01000c000000:021e020000]
Too bad!

If you can't find that last tile,
the floor's as good as gone!

You'd better give it another try.

First try picking a random tile to
start from and see how far you can go.
You have to find a path that will allow
all the tiles to fall away.

If you reach a dead end before all the
tiles have been cleared, you'll need to
either start from a different tile or
try going in another direction.

The first tile that falls is a diamond.

The last tile that falls is a spade.

One of the two spade tiles in the second
column from the left is the last tile
that falls.
