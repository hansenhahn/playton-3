This photograph shows the surface of a
pond a few moments after somebody threw
in a handful of pebbles.

Assuming no pebbles landed in the exact
same spot, how many pebbles were thrown?
All the ripples captured in the photograph
came from pebbles.

A ripple of applause!

Six pebbles were thrown into the pond.

Too bad!

Try using the Memo Function to help you
work out where all the ripples are coming
from.

Ripples that have the same centre all
came from the same pebble, no matter
what size the ripples are.

Here's another way to think about
Hint 1: the number of pebbles thrown
into the pond is equal to the number of
centres.

If you think that only four pebbles
were thrown, take a closer look.

Have you noticed the largest ripple,
for example?
!******************************!
[f10b010010000000:02ff020000]
The largest ripple runs from top to
bottom through the middle of the
photograph. It's easy to mistake it for
a ripple coming from the pebble that
landed in the bottom-left corner, but in
fact it has a different centre.

Now, are there any more?
