You've received a note:

{''}After entering the building, I went
through the first door on my right
and entered a room. From there, I went
through the door on my left, straight
through a room, across the corridor and
into the room opposite. I then went
through the door on my right and ended
up in the room where I am now.{''}

To find the sender by following the
directions, which entrance, A to F,
should you use to enter the building?

Very good!

Entrance E is the only one that will allow
you to follow all the steps.

The messenger is in the room shown above.

Too bad!

Pay close attention to the path described
in the note.

Try following the directions from each
entrance, one at a time.

Every entrance has a door immediately to
the right, but you can eliminate all the
ones that don't lead into a room with
a door on the left. Just keep narrowing
the choices down one by one.

Be sure to take into account which way
the different entrances are facing.
