{''}I was considered quite the catch in my
younger days, you know! This is a picture
of me back then, along with three of my
handsome suitors. A few moments after
this photo was taken, one of these
gents expressed his love for me by
presenting me with a heart.{''}

Which one of these men, A-C, is the suitor
in question?
!******************************!
[ec0b01000b000000:0253010000]
Lovely answer!

It was him all right!

He made a heart out of the magazine he
was holding. Quite a creative gesture, eh?

There's no inspiration like true love...

Too bad!

Pay close attention to what each
gentleman is holding.
!******************************!
[ee0b01000d000000:0237020000]
Each gentleman is holding something
different. Concentrate on those items.

The heart she's talking about isn't
drawn on anything that the gentlemen
are holding. She must be referring to
something shaped like a heart. Hmm...
How can you make a heart shape?
!******************************!
[f00b01000f000000:0237030000]
One of the three gentlemen is holding
something that could easily be turned
into a heart shape.

Take another look.

It wasn't a beautiful bouquet or an
enchanting melody that charmed her.

It was a loving gesture!
