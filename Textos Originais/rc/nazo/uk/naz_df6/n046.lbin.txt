Create a tunnel that leads from the
entrance to the exit, going through every
segment on the way.

Touch a tile to switch between a straight
and a curved segment. Touch the edge of
a tile and slide it in a circle to rotate it.

The green tiles are already in their
correct positions, so you can't change
them. 

Good luck!

Good work!

Crikey, that was a project and a half!
!******************************!
[ed0b01000c000000:0287010000]
Too bad!

Keep trying, that tunnel won't finish
itself!
!******************************!
[ee0b01000d000000:02bf010000]
This tunnel has no intersections, which
means it forms a continuous line from
the entrance to the exit.
!******************************!
[ef0b01000e000000:0227020000]
There are no other ways out of the
tunnel apart from the entrance and
exit. As you can see, the segment in the
bottom-right corner has to be curved
and it's clear which way it has to turn.
The segment in the top-left corner also
has to be curved so it can connect to
the fixed piece on its right.

These are the types of little hints you
should use to work this puzzle out,
bit by bit.
!******************************!
[f00b01000f000000:02a9030000]
You can use the information from Hint
2 to determine the third, fourth and
fifth segments from the entrance.

Try to integrate the nearby fixed
segments into the sequence and it's
clear what the next two are.
!******************************!
[f10b010010000000:027a040000]
The segment beneath the exit is
straight, and the piece below that
connects to the fixed segment on its
left.

You can work out the rest.
