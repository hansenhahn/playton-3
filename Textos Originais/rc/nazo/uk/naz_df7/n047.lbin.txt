One of these students broke a window, so
you ask each of them who did it, in order.

A: {''}I didn't do it.{''}
B: {''}A is telling the truth.{''}
C: {''}D is lying.{''}
D: {''}It certainly wasn't me.{''}

The one whose story sounds fishy is the
culprit. Who is it?
!******************************!
[ec0b01000b000000:021b010000]
That's right!

C broke the window.
He said that D was lying, even though D
hadn't spoken yet.

It doesn't get any fishier than that!

[ed0b01000c000000:02a0010000]
Too bad.

Ask them again, {''}in order{''}.
!******************************!
[ee0b01000d000000:02cc010000]
Listen carefully to their testimonies, in
order...
!******************************!
[ef0b01000e000000:02ff010000]
Look again at the content of each
testimony and the order in which they
are given.

Do that, and you'll soon notice that
one of them is saying something not
quite right.
!******************************!
[f00b01000f000000:02a9020000]
The culprit is the one who spoke in
haste. If you'd heard the testimonies
in the opposite order, the culprit might
never have given themselves away.

[f10b010010000000:023e030000]
The culprit gave the game away while
trying to pin the blame on D.
