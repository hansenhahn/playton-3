Two criminals want to use this board to
seal off the cave where they store their
smuggled goods.

If they cut the board into two pieces of
identical size and shape, they'll be able
to seal the cave entrance completely.

Draw lines on the board to indicate
where it needs to be cut.

Good job!

The board needs to be cut as shown
above.

As you can see, the criminals have flipped
one of the pieces and sealed the cave
entrance tight.

Bad luck.

It's not a particularly complicated cut
that's required here.

Count the number of squares the board
is made up of.

Since the two pieces you need must be
the same size, they will be made up of
the same number of squares.

The board has to be cut into two pieces
of seven squares each. The pieces also
have to be the same shape, so you can't
just cut any two seven-square pieces.

Try visualising the shape that the two
pieces will be after being cut.

First off, look for two rectangles
containing six squares each.

There are only two ways of cutting
out two separate six-square
rectangles. The important point is
working out how to integrate the two
remaining squares.

Split up the bottom two squares in
the middle column and you'll be 
very close to getting the answer.

Can you visualise two boot-shaped
pieces?
