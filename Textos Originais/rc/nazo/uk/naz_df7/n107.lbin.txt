You've received eyewitness reports about
a shady trio. They all wore red, white
and green, but none of them wore the
same combination. Here's what witnesses
had to say about them:
{''}The men wore jackets of the same
colour.{''}
{''}Two of them had white trousers on.{''}
{''}The larger man wore a white hat.{''}
{''}The woman's jacket was green.{''}

Touch the trio's clothes to change
the colours so that they match the
eyewitness reports.

Smashing!

For a shady trio, their clothes might be a
bit too conspicuous.
!******************************!
[ed0b01000c000000:0216020000]
Too bad!

Start with what you know for sure and
the rest shouldn't be too difficult.

[ee0b01000d000000:026b020000]
You know for sure that the large man
has a white hat and the woman has a
green jacket. That's your starting
point.

You also know that the men have the
same colour jackets. So what colour
must their jackets be?
!******************************!
[ef0b01000e000000:023e030000]
The large man has a white hat. This
means the men's jackets cannot be
white.

Two of the three scoundrels are wearing
white trousers, and you know the large
chap isn't one of them.

Now that you know which two have white
trousers on, see if you can work out
the rest.

[f00b01000f000000:024a040000]
The woman's jacket is green and her
trousers are white. Therefore, her hat
must be red.

Remember, they are all wearing all three
colours, but none of them are wearing
the same combination. Keep this in mind
and you'll be fine!
!******************************!
[f10b010010000000:022e050000]
You know that the man in the middle
has white trousers. In order to avoid
the same combination as the woman,
therefore, his hat must be green and
his jacket must be red.

Fill in all those colours and you'll
have this puzzle solved in no time!
