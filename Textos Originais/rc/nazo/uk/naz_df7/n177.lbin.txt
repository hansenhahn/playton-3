Several square carpets of the same size
have been laid on top of each other. No
carpet is completely hidden and none of
them have been folded.

Which carpet is at the bottom of the pile?

Touch that carpet and then touch <CR>Submit</C>.

Magical!

It's the carpet in the top-right.

The best way to find the answer to this
one is to work backwards from the carpet
that is completely visible, checking the
overlaps carefully.

Lost the thread?

Don't get distracted by the pretty
patterns!

It doesn't take a carpet-fitter to work
out that the carpet in the bottom-left
is on the top of the pile.

Start from there and work in sequence.
The next carpet down is the orange one,
and the one under that has the wide
stripe pattern. Right, which one's next?
