A full deck of 52 cards (without jokers)
has been shuffled and divided into three
roughly equal piles.

The pile on the left has 17 cards, four
of which are red. The middle pile has
18 cards, six of which are red.

How many of the cards in the pile on
the right are black?

Excellent!

There is one black card.

In the left pile of 17 cards, there are
4 red and 13 black. In the middle pile
of 18 cards, there are 6 red and 12
black. In the pile on the right, then,
there must be 16 red cards and just one
black card!

These cards were shuffled, right?

Too bad!

Don't overthink it.

This puzzle can be solved with simple
addition and subtraction.

Remember, there is an equal number
of red and black cards in a full deck.
