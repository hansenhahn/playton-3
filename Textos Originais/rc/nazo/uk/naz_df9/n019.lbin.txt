You've been given two keys to the
Laytonmobile, but there's no keyhole in
which to insert them. Instead, the door
can be opened by entering a certain
number.

This number is hidden somewhere in the
keys. What is it?

[ec0b01000b000000:02e9000000]
That's right!

The hidden number is 47. You can see this
number when you put the ends of the keys
together!

Give it another try!

The number is hidden somewhere in the
two keys.

You won't find it by just looking at
them, though. Try moving them around!

You won't find the number using just
one of the keys. Move both keys around
a bit and give it some thought.

Aligning the keys just right will make
the secret number appear.

Keep the blue key on top and rotate
the yellow key 180 degrees. Align the
teeth of the keys and...
