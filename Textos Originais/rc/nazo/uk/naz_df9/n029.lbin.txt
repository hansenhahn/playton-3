You've dug some tunnels, but they've
ended up looking like an ant farm.
You have to connect A to A', B to B'
and C to C', but you can't use the same
path twice.

In order to do this, however, one of your
connections must go above ground.

Is this connection A, B or C?

Wonderful!

You can make all three connections if
C goes above ground.

Too bad!

Give it another try.

Starting from A, head towards the right
side of the screen at the first
junction you encounter.

Starting from B, head towards the left
side of the screen at the first
junction you encounter.

Starting from C, head towards the left
of the screen at the first junction you
encounter.

Starting from A', head towards the right
of the screen at the first junction you
encounter.

Starting from B', head towards the top
of the screen at the first junction you
encounter.

Starting from C', keep going straight at
the first junction you encounter.

Based on the instructions in the first
three hints, you should be able to
complete connection A and ascertain
that it doesn't go above ground. So
now all you have to do is work out the
other two.
