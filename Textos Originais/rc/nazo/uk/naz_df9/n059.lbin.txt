An uncommonly clever rabbit has imposed
some rather strange rules upon its
movement. It can jump 70 cm forwards, but
after every jump forwards, it must jump
30 cm in the direction of its tail.

If this rabbit needed to travel 10 m in a
straight line, what is the lowest number of
jumps in which it could cover the distance?

!******************************!
[ec0b01000b000000:0256010000]
That's right!

The answer is 20 jumps.
After every 70 cm jump forwards, the
rabbit turns around 180 degrees and
jumps a further 30 cm in the direction
of its tail, thereby covering 1 m in two
jumps.

Bad luck!

The rabbit is certainly eccentric, but
there is no doubt it is clever.

A quick calculation will tell you that
if the rabbit jumps forwards 70 cm and
then jumps 30 cm backwards in the
direction of its tail, it will cover
40 cm of ground every two jumps.
Isn't there a way of making slightly
faster progress?

By performing a certain action after
jumping 70 cm forwards, the rabbit can
allow itself to jump even further
towards its goal.

Think of a way to avoid wasting the
30 cm jump in the direction of its tail.

The key to this puzzle is rotation.

By turning on the spot, the rabbit is
able to jump even further towards its
goal.
!******************************!
[f10b010010000000:02a1040000]
After the first jump, the rabbit turns
around 180 degrees and performs its
second jump. When it lands, it turns
around again and starts its next jump.
Repeating this pattern is the most
efficient way of moving towards its
goal, even if it does make the poor
rabbit dizzy...
