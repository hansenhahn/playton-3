Your escape route is blocked...by blocks!

Luckily, you have five bombs at your
disposal. Each bomb will completely
destroy the block it's placed on.
Remaining blocks will fall into any empty
spaces created by blocks destroyed below
them, but they won't change shape.

Place your five bombs onto the five
blocks that, when destroyed, will
leave behind a flat surface you can
drive across. Then touch that detonator!

Boom!

Great job. Now get out of here!
!******************************!
[ed0b01000c000000:02d8010000]
Too bad!

Now hurry up and try again!
!******************************!
[ee0b01000d000000:02fe010000]
There are five specific blocks you need
to destroy. Don't worry about making a
mistake, though. You can try again as
many times as you want, so just have
fun blowing stuff up! You're bound to
work it out eventually.

If you look closely, you'll notice that
the blocks are made up of evenly sized
squares. Also, the pit is five squares
deep. Start your thinking from here.

There are three blocks on the bottom
row. You need to destroy the one on
the left and the one on the right.
Leave the middle block intact.

[f10b010010000000:02fc030000]
Do not destroy the square block in the
top-right of the stack.
