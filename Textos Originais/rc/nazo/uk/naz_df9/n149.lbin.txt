Here are three strange symbols: A, B and C.

If A is 63 and B is 89, what on earth could
C be?

You can take it for granted that C will be
a two-digit number as well.

[ec0b01000b000000:02b8000000]
Correct!

The answer is 52.

When the symbols are rotated 90 degrees
clockwise and a line is drawn down the
middle, they appear as 63, 89 and 52.

Bad luck.

Try looking at the symbols from a bit
further away.

Think about the relationship between
the symbols and the numbers.

Try using the Memo Function to write
down the numbers. You'll need to write
them in quite an angular way.

Try tilting your head a little to the
left and look at the symbols again.

Can you see anything?

Use the Memo Function to colour in the
cavities in each symbol. When you've
finished colouring, use the eraser to
rub out a straight horizontal line
through the middle of the symbols.

Are you seeing it now?

Okay, here comes the big hint:

After following the instructions in Hint
3, try looking at the symbols from the
right-hand side of the screen.

Can you see some digital-clock style
numbers?
