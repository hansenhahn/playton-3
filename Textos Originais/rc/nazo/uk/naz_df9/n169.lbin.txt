some sporting equipment and says:

{''}I love all kinds of sport, but there's
one piece of equipment here that wasn't
designed with me in mind.{''}

What could he be talking about?

Hole in one!

The answer is the golf club.
All the equipment except the golf club can
be used equally well by right-handed or
left-handed people.

are held in one's hands when they're
being used.
