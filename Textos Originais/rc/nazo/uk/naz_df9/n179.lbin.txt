This cheeky little magpie has been stealing
one gem a day over a period of 10 days,
and has brought them all back to its nest.

There are four colours of gem in the
nest: white, black, red and blue.

The number of white gems is half the
number of black gems. The number of black
gems is half the number of red gems.

How many gems are there of each colour?
!******************************!
[ec0b01000b000000:0276010000]
That's right!

One white.
Two black.
Four red.
Three blue.

Well collected!

Too bad.

Do you suppose the magpie cares about
the colour of the gems?

There are 10 gems in total - that is an
indisputable fact. Among these, there is
at least one gem of each colour. The
question is what colour each of the
other six gems is.

You know from the puzzle that there
are more red gems than black gems, and
more black gems than white gems (red,
black, white). Think about the facts
you've been given and the answer should
present itself.
