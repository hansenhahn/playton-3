<V0000><T>Professor, I hope this letter finds
you well.<W><W> As for me, I am in quite
a predicament.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:8369838C815B835683878393>
<V0010><T>You see, the London we know and
love has been thrown into
absolute chaos.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:8369838C815B835683878393>
<V0020><T>To complicate matters, the
calamity I speak of does not take
place in your time.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:8369838C815B835683878393>
<V0030><T>This may be difficult to believe,<W>
but I am writing to you from 10
years in the future.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:8369838C815B835683878393>
<V0040><T>I know this is a lot to take in,
but I'll explain it all soon.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:8369838C815B835683878393>
<V0050><T>For now, I ask that you head to
the clock shop on Midland Road in
Baldwin.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:8369838C815B835683878393>
<V0060><T>I look forward to seeing you again.

     <W120>Your student, Luke Triton</V>

<V0070><T>Strange as it sounds, it seems that
the author of this letter is none
other than your future self, Luke.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838B815B834E>
<V0080><T>From...my future self?</T> <T><W><W>But how
is that even possible?</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838C834383678393>
<V0090><T>I don't know, but it does raise the
question: if this letter is indeed
authentic, how did it get here?</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838B815B834E>
<V0100><T>Um...<W> By time-travelling postman?</T><W>
<A2/2><T>Just joking, of course!</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838B815B834E>
<T><V0101>But seriously, I think this mystery
might be the strangest we've ever
encountered!</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838C834383678393>
<V0110><T><A1/2>Indeed. And even in the future, you
seem to need my help in solving it.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838C834383678393>
<T><V0111>Your constancy can be quite a
comfort in these uncertain times,
my boy.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838B815B834E>
<V0120><T><A2/1>Er...<W></T><T> Well, thank you, I think.<W>
But back to the letter - how do we
know it's real?</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838C834383678393>
<V0130><T><A1/1><K>Hmm...</K> Well, we haven't much to go
on yet.</T></V>
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838C834383678393>
<T><V0135><T>But I can't help but think that this
strange occurrence is connected to
the terrible events of last week.</V>

<V0140><T><K><A1/1>Hmm...</V>
