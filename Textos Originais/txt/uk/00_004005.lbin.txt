<T>Hrm.<W> Well, the food certainly isn't
anything to write home about.
!******************************!
<T>Sorry you feel that way, sir.
I think it's quite - chomp chomp -
scrumptious, myself.
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>Bah. This over-salted chop and pile
of wilted greens have nothing on
Amelie's cooking.
!******************************!
<T>If that's how you feel, sir, I'd be
happy to relieve you of that, um,
burden.
!******************************!
<T><A1/3>Now see here, Barton! If you don't
return my chop at once, I'll have
you driving a desk next week!
!******************************!
<T>It would be worth it! Mmm... 
This crackling is, um, cracking!
!******************************!
<T>Hrm! They don't seem to be in any
hurry to get this show started.
!******************************!
<T>Come on, sir, it's not all bad.
At least there's - shlurp - food
to enjoy while we wait.
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>Honestly, I'm knee-deep in case
work. I haven't got the time
for fancy banquets.
!******************************!
<T>Chomp! Oh my, sir, you should try
this. It's - chomp chomp -
absolutely lovely.
!******************************!
