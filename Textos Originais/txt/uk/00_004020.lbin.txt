<V0010><T>I have to say, I feel a bit out of
place here, Professor.</V>
!******************************!
<V0020><T>That's quite understandable, Luke.</V>
!******************************!
<T><V0021>I'm sure most people would feel the
same way in the presence of the
prime minister.</V>
!******************************!
<V0030><T><A1/6>Hey look! I think I see Inspector
Chelmey over there!</V>
!******************************!
<V0040><T><K><A4/5>Hmm...</V>
!******************************!
<V0050><T><A2/1>So, Professor, what do you think
about this whole event?</V>
!******************************!
<T><V0051>Do you think that someone has
really built a working time machine?</V>
!******************************!
<V0060><T><A1/1>I'm not entirely sure.</V>
!******************************!
<T><V0061>Still, if it proves to be true, can
you imagine the stir it will cause in
the scientific community?</V>
!******************************!
<V0070><T><A4/2>Well, I think it's really exciting!<W>
Though you don't sound entirely
convinced, Professor.</V>
!******************************!
<V0080><T><A1/2>Anything's possible, Luke.<W> But I
won't be convinced until I've seen
the contraption work for myself.</V>
!******************************!
<V0090><T><A3/1>And I must confess, something
about this entire presentation
seems a bit...off.</V>
!******************************!
<V0100><T><A1/1>Why do you say that?</V>
!******************************!
<T><V0101><A2/2>Ah, of course.<W><W> That must be your
famous intuition talking, eh?</V>
!******************************!
<V0110><T>That's one way of putting it.<W> <A1/2>But
enough speculation. <W>Look over
there, Luke.</V>
!******************************!
<V0120><T><A4/1>That guard? What about him?</V>
!******************************!
<V0130><T><A2/2>He seems to be looking for a man
who snuck into the event uninvited.</V>
!******************************!
<V0140><T><A3/1>Ooh! So we have an intruder in our
midst!</V>
!******************************!
