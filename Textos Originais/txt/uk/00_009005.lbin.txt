<T><A3/1>Well, here we are.<W><A3/2> The clock shop
that the letter mentioned should be
around here somewhere. But where?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>This seems an ideal time to consult
the map that accompanied the
letter.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A2/1>Here, Luke.<W><A2/2> See if you can find
the shop's location by yourself.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A2/2>Say no more, Professor!
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A4/4>Hmm. This is more difficult than
I expected.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Let me give this puzzle another
shot!
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A3/2>Great! Getting to that clock shop
should be a doddle now. Let's go,
Professor!
!******************************!
<HDR:8369838C815B835683878393>
<T><A4/2>All right.<W><A2/2> But before we head off,
let's quickly review how to move
around.
!******************************!
<HDR:8369838C815B835683878393>
<T>Care to assist me, Luke?
!******************************!
<HDR:8369838C815B835683878393>
<T>I know the drill, Professor. I can
take it from here.<W> Let's see...
To start, touch the shoe icon.
!******************************!
<HDR:8369838C815B835683878393>
<T>Once you've touched the shoe,
arrows will appear. Touch an arrow
to move in that direction.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/2>That's right.<W> So just remember,
whenever you want to move,
start by touching the shoe.
