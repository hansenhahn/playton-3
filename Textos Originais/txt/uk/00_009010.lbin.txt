<T>Well hello there, you strapping
young things!
!******************************!
<T><A2/0>I can tell from the looks on your
faces that you're just dying to
hear something useful!
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>All right, here's my pearl of wisdom.
Go and touch that car parked over
there.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Oi! Get your hands off me! Touch
that car parked over there, I said!
!******************************!
<T><A4/4>But...what about the car?
!******************************!
<T>Dear me, you've made quite a mess,
haven't you? Now why did you go
and do a thing like that?
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>It wasn't m-my fault! You were the
one who told me to touch it!
!******************************!
<T>Oh, did I now?<W> I certainly don't
recall saying anything of the sort.
