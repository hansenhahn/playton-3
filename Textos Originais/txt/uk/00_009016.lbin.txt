<T><A1/5>Oh no! It just fell apart!
!******************************!
<T>Never mind that! Did you see the
coin that just popped out?<W> That's
a hint coin, and it's yours to keep.
!******************************!
<T>If you ever find yourself stuck on
a puzzle, you can spend one of
those lovely coins to get a hint.
!******************************!
<T>Just remember that there's a limit
to the number of hint coins you can
find.
!******************************!
<T>If you use them willy-nilly, you may
find yourself in a pickle later.
!******************************!
<T>Hint coins are tucked away all over
the place, so touch anything that
looks fishy. You might find a coin!
!******************************!
<T>Well, that's the end of my speech.
<W>Good luck with whatever it is
you're doing round here.<W> Ta-ta!
