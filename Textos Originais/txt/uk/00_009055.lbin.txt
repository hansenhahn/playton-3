<T><A3/1>Where do you suppose these stairs
go to, Professor?

<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I'd say they probably lead up to
that row of charming Victorian

<T><A1/2>Say, Luke, all this talk of stairs
has reminded me of a puzzle. Care
to hear it?

<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A3/2>Would I ever!

<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A4/4>I suppose I'm not in the mood for
a puzzle after all.

<T>Let's give that stairs puzzle
another go.

<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>There probably aren't any clock
shops in a quiet residential area
like that.
