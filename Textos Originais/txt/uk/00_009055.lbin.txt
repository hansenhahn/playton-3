go to, Professor?
!******************************!
<T>I'd say they probably lead up to

<T><A1/2>Say, Luke, all this talk of stairs
has reminded me of a puzzle. Care

<T><A4/4>I suppose I'm not in the mood for
a puzzle after all.
!******************************!
<T>Let's give that stairs puzzle
another go.
!******************************!
<T>Exemplary thinking, Luke. Now let's

!******************************!
<T>There probably aren't any clock
shops in a quiet residential area
like that.
