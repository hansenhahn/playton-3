<T><A1/2>That'll be my husband.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Wait till you see the little gem I
picked up today, love...<W> <A2/1>Oh my,
customers!
!******************************!
<T>Welcome back, dear. This here is
Professor Layton.
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>He tells me he has some business
in our shop.
!******************************!
<T>Layton? You're Professor Layton?<W>
My apologies! I wasn't expecting
you so soon!
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>No apology necessary, my good
man.<W> Oh, and allow me to introduce
my-
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Apprentice! I'm the professor's
apprentice, Luke! Pleased to meet
you, sir!
!******************************!
<T>Luke, you say? Hmm...
!******************************!
<T>What I mean to say is, those are
some fine manners, lad! It's nice to
meet you too. The name's Cogg.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>You seemed a bit flustered by our
arrival, Cogg. We certainly don't
mean to impose...
!******************************!
<T>Oh no, no, no. It's no trouble
at all.
!******************************!
<T>It's just that I had instructions
to show you our biggest clock in
action upon your arrival.
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>It certainly is a beauty. Pity it's
not in working order.
!******************************!
<T>Yes, I'd planned to give her a
tune-up before you stopped by, so
you could see her in all her glory.
!******************************!
<T>But I'm getting on a bit these days,
and I have trouble keeping the old
girl in good repair.
!******************************!
<T>I can't remember where to insert
this last gear, and the clock won't
work without it.
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>Ah, I see. That does indeed sound
problematic.
!******************************!
<T>Maybe you can help. The papers say
you're a learned man. Can you work
out where this gear goes?
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Hmm? Me?<W> Well, I'd like to help,
but I'm no expert in mechanics...
!******************************!
<T>Well, at least give it a try. Don't
you want to see our biggest clock
in its full working glory?
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>I certainly do.<W> <A4/2>Very well, I'll
give it a shot.
!******************************!
<T>Sorry, Professor. Until we get
that gear back in place, I can't
show you the clock in motion.
!******************************!
<T>Can you work out where this gear
goes, Professor?
!******************************!
<T>That did the trick!<W> <A3/0>Just wait here,
and I'll go and start her up!
!******************************!
<T>Here goes!
!******************************!
