<T>This room's got the best view in
the whole hotel. Lucky for you that
it was available.

<T><A4/1>Did you hear that, Professor?
What a stroke of luck!

<T><A1/5>Yeah... Though come to think of it,
I suppose it's not really luck at all.

<T>We haven't had a single guest since
we moved the hotel to this new
location, you see.

<T>So the Hotel Duke used to be
located somewhere else?

<T><A4/4>Erm... It's a bit of a touchy
subject, so I'd rather not go into
it. I hope you understand...

<T><A2/2>Hey, I was really impressed with
the way you solved the puzzle that
Granny threw at you, you know.
!******************************!
[hdr:000a00000002630000000260020000]
[inf:838b815b834e]
<T>Well, I do like a good puzzle...

[hdr:000a00000002000000000284020000]

<T>Me too! How about this: solve this
puzzle for me, and I'll tell you how
to get to the station.

solve my puzzle if you want me to
tell you where the station is.

<T><A1/1>Nicely done!<W> Oh! I nearly forgot you
were trying to get to the station.
!******************************!
[hdr:00b80b0000020000000002f6030000]
[inf:83788362834c815b]
<T>It's not too far. Just keep going
east once you leave the hotel.

Street. Head north and the station
will be on your right.

[hdr:00b80b0000026300000002f1040000]

<T>Hmm? What's that?

[hdr:00b80b000002000000000206050000]
[inf:83788362834c815b]
<T>It's a bit of a detour, but you
should drop by the arcade on your
way to the station.
!******************************!
[hdr:00b80b00000200000000025f050000]
[inf:83788362834c815b]
<T>There's a restaurant there that's 
just scrumptious!

serve here, of course, but it's not
half bad, you know?

[hdr:00b80b0000026300000002f8050000]

where the little boy is standing,
blocking the entrance?

as well go through the arcade and
see a bit more of the area.
