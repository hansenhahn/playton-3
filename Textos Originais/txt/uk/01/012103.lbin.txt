<T>Ah, young man! Do you have a
moment?

<T>Hmm? Are you talking to me?

<T>I am indeed, er...Luke, was it?
!******************************!
[hdr:000a0000000235000000027e000000]
[inf:838b815b834e]
<T>That's right!
What can I do for you?

[inf:837d815b834b838c83628367]
<T>Oh, it's nothing terribly important.
It's just been a while since we had
a youngster like yourself here.

<T>That's why I thought I'd welcome
you with a gift.

[inf:837d815b834b838c83628367]
<T>That's right. These are all the
rage with the local children, I
hear.

<T>Oh, it's one of those toy cars!
!******************************!
[hdr:0014000000023500000002d5010000]

<T><A1/5>Me? Hah!<W> No way. I'm not into
kiddie toys like that.

[hdr:001400000002350000000235020000]

<T><A1/2>Not that there's anything wrong
with having an interest in toys, of
course.

<T>I mean, that car is perfect for a
boy your age. You have fun with it
now!
!******************************!
[hdr:0014000000023500000002e4020000]
[inf:838b815b834e]
<T>Um... Yeah, I'll try.

<T>Don't look so glum, Luke. Collecting
miniature cars is a perfectly
respectable hobby for a gentleman.
