<T><A3/1><K>...<W></K>Here, you two saw that
ne'er-do-well skulking around,
didn't you?
!******************************!
[hdr:000a000000025f0000000268000000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T>Yes we did. Why do you ask?
!******************************!
[hdr:000a00000002000000000287000000]
[inf:834583628359]
<T>I thought I should give you a word
of advice. That whole gang is bad
news.
!******************************!

<T>They call themselves {''}the Family{''},
and they monitor everything people
get up to around these parts.

<T>Who are you talking about exactly?
!******************************!
[hdr:000a00000002000000000268010000]
[inf:834583628359]
<T>I'm sure you've seen them, all
dressed the same, in their long
grey coats and matching hats.
!******************************!
[hdr:000a000000020000000002c8010000]
[inf:834583628359]
<T>Oh, and don't even try to be a
hero. Bravery will only get you
in the worst kind of trouble.
!******************************!
[hdr:00140000000228020000022f020000]
[inf:838b815b834e]
<T>But why don't the police do
something about them?
!******************************!
[hdr:001400000002000000000264020000]
[inf:834583628359]
<T>Police?<W> Now there's a word I
haven't heard in a while...
!******************************!
[hdr:0014000000020000000002a3020000]
[inf:834583628359]
<T>I haven't seen police on these
streets for years. It's the Family
who make the law nowadays.
!******************************!
[hdr:001e000000025f0000000203030000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T>How terrible.

[hdr:001e00000002000000000214030000]
[inf:834583628359]
<T>You're telling me. I- Oops, here
comes one of their boys now.<A4/1> Try
not to stare.

<T>Would you mind if I had a look at
that paper you're holding, sir?
!******************************!
[hdr:001e000000020000000002b2030000]
[inf:834583628359]
<T><A3/1>Go for it. Knock yourself out.

<T><A3/1>N-no! That can't be...
!******************************!
[hdr:0028000000022802000002fa030000]
[inf:838b815b834e]
<T>Professor, look at the date on
this paper!
!******************************!
[hdr:003200000002000000000228040000]
[inf:834583628359]
<T><A1/1>Keep your hair on, fellas. It's just
a newspaper.
!******************************!
[hdr:003200000002000000000263040000]
[inf:834583628359]
<T>Right, I've got to go. Places to be
and all that. Can I have my paper
back?
!******************************!
[hdr:0037000000022802000002b2040000]
[inf:838b815b834e]
<T>Oh yes, of course. Thank you.
!******************************!
[hdr:003c000000022802000002d3040000]
[inf:838b815b834e]
<T>I didn't misread the date on that
paper, did I, Professor?
!******************************!
[hdr:003c000000025f0000000211050000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T>I don't think so, Luke. It was dated
10 years in the future.<W> It's as if
we've travelled through time...
!******************************!
[hdr:003c0000000228020000027f050000]
[inf:838b815b834e]
<T>So maybe the reason why nothing
looks familiar is that we're in the
London of the future.
!******************************!
[hdr:003c000000025f00000002dc050000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T>It would appear so...
!******************************!
[hdr:003c000000025f00000002f5050000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T>Whoever wrote us that last letter
assured us that we'd find proof of
our time travel at Green Hospital.
!******************************!
[hdr:003c000000025f0000000260060000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T>Let's make our way over there
without further delay.
