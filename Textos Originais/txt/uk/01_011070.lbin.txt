<T><A2/1>Hmm... There's something fishy
about this area too.<W> It looks
completely different from before.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Indeed, Luke. <A4/5>There's something
going on here that I don't fully
understand.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Oh, wait! I think I know what
happened!<W><A3/2> We must've left the
shop through a different door.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>We're probably taking a different
route away from the shop.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/1>No, that can't be right.<W> Think back
to when we left the shop, Luke.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>We left through the same door that
we used to enter. I'm absolutely
certain of that.

<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A4/4>Yes, I suppose you're right,
Professor.<W> But what else could
explain this change in scenery?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A3/1>Let's investigate the vicinity a bit
more. Perhaps that will help us
shed some light on things.
