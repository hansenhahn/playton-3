<T><A4/5>Augh!<W> What is it?!<W> <A5/1>I didn't d-<W30>d-<W30>do
anything, I swear!<W> I know nothing!

<T><A1/2>Are you all right, sir? You're
dripping with perspiration. May I
suggest a calming cup of tea?
!******************************!
<T><A6/0>Sorry about the s-<W30>s-<W30>sweat, sir!
!******************************!
<T>I'll make your t-<W30>t-<W30>tea right away!

<T><A1/1>Crikey, he didn't half leave in a
hurry!

<T><A4/1>Actually, you seem to be making a

why.

<T><A3/1>My hat, in particular, seems to
be making many of the people we
meet feel uncomfortable...
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>I don't know why anyone would be
afraid of you or your hat.

not there. Hmm...
