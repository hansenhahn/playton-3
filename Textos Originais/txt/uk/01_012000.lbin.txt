<V0030><T>Professor, if you're reading this,
it means you've made it safely to
my time.</V>
!******************************!
<T><V0031>I can hardly wait to see you again.</V>
!******************************!
<V0040><T>I wish to enlist your help in freeing
this town from the tragedy that
has befallen it.</V>
!******************************!
<V0050><T>But first, I'm sure you'll want some
proof that you're actually in the
future.</V>
!******************************!
<V0060><T>I've thought long and hard about
the best way of convincing you.</V>
!******************************!
<V0070><T>Make your way through town to the
address below. What you find there
is sure to quell any doubts.</V>
!******************************!
<V0080><T>Room 312
Green Hospital
123 Auckland Lane</V>
!******************************!
<T>It seems our next destination has
been decided for us. Let's pay this
hospital a visit.
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Sounds good, Professor. But how
do we get to Auckland Lane?
!******************************!
<T>It would be easy if the buses were
running, but unfortunately that's
not the case.
!******************************!
<T>Perhaps that lady over there
knows of a different way to get
around town.
