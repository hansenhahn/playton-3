it means you've made it safely to
my time.</V>

<T><V0031>I can hardly wait to see you again.</V>

<HDR:8369838C815B835683878393>
<V0040><T>I wish to enlist your help in freeing
this town from the tragedy that
has befallen it.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:8369838C815B835683878393>
<V0050><T>But first, I'm sure you'll want some
proof that you're actually in the
future.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:8369838C815B835683878393>
<V0060><T>I've thought long and hard about
the best way of convincing you.</V>

<T>It seems our next destination has
been decided for us. Let's pay this
hospital a visit.

<T><A3/1>Sounds good, Professor. But how

<T>It would be easy if the buses were
running, but unfortunately that's
not the case.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Perhaps that lady over there
knows of a different way to get
around town.
