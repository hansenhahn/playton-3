<T>Excuse me. We're trying to get to
Auckland Lane, but the buses don't
seem to go there any more.
!******************************!
<T>Spot on, boyo.<W> Them buses had
already stopped running when I
moved here, two years ago.
!******************************!
<T>Two years ago? But...<W>the poster
says the buses won't stop running
for another five years.
!******************************!
<T>What are you talking about?<W>
That poster is five years old!<A3/0> Sums
not your strong spot, boyo?
!******************************!
<T>But that can't be right! Unless...
!******************************!
<T>Luke! That's enough.
!******************************!
<T>I do apologise for my friend,
madam.
!******************************!
<T>Don't you find the lack of buses in
this area a bit of an inconvenience,
though?
!******************************!
<T>Not at all. If I need to take
public transport, I hop on the
train, don't I?
!******************************!
<T>There's a station on Flatstone
Street, see.
!******************************!
<T>Tourists, is it?
!******************************!
<T>You should take your questions to
the hotel on Southern Street. It's
just down the road.
!******************************!
<T>They'll help you find where you need
to go.
!******************************!
<T>Thank you for your assistance,
madam.
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>Tourists? Us?<W> Hmph! 
!******************************!
<T>I was born and raised here! I've
lived in London longer than she has!
!******************************!
<T>Now, Luke, there's no need to get
all wound up. Let's find that hotel.
!******************************!
<T>If you've got any more questions
about the city, ask at the hotel on
Southern Street, over by there.
!******************************!
