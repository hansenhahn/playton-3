<T>Hi there. We're looking for a hotel
on Southern Street. Is it one of
these buildings?
!******************************!
<T><A3/0>BZZT!<W> <A2/3>Incorrect!
!******************************!
<T>Wait... We are on Southern Street
here, aren't we? But the hotel
is not here?
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>DING DING DING!<W> <A1/2>You're in the
neighbourhood! In the neighbourhood
of correct, that is.
!******************************!
<T>I can't make head nor tail of what
this boy's saying, Professor.
!******************************!
<T>He's only trying to help, Luke. You
just need to keep to very simple
questions. Observe.
!******************************!
<T>Tell me, young man, is this Southern
Street?
!******************************!
<T>DING DING DING!<W> Correct!
!******************************!
<T>And is there a hotel east of here?
!******************************!
<T>DING DING DING!<W> Correct again!<W>
Just look for the white building
up ahead.
!******************************!
<T>Thank you.
!******************************!
<T>All right, Luke. Unless our friend
here is mistaken, we need to head
east to get to our destination.
!******************************!
<T>Erm... If you say so, Professor.
!******************************!
<T>The hotel is the big white building
up ahead. Just keep heading east!
!******************************!
