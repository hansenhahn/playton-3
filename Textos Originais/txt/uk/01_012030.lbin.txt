<T>Good day, young lady. Would you
happen to know whether this
establishment is a hotel?
!******************************!
<T>Hello there, gentlemen. If you're
looking for a hotel, you've come
to the right place!
!******************************!
<T>Hotel Duke is one of London's
finest and most famous!
!******************************!
<T>Will you be doing us the honour of
staying here?
!******************************!
<T>For a famous hotel, you keep an
awfully low profile.<W> This is the
first I've heard of a Hotel Duke.
!******************************!
<T><A4/5>Well, there's a simple explanation
for that.
!******************************!
<T>The Hotel Duke caters for ladies
and gentlemen of means and
taste.
!******************************!
<T>I can't say we're as popular with
the primary school crowd, little
boy.
!******************************!
<T>Ho ho! Our friend doesn't take
kindly to you besmirching the good
name of her hotel, Luke.
!******************************!
<T>Thank you for your help, young
lady.
!******************************!
