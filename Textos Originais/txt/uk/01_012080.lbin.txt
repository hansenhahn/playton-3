<T><A3/1>We know your name, Becky. You told
us earlier, remember? <A3/2>My name is
Luke, by the way!

<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Oh, and there's no need to be so
formal. All that politeness makes
me feel awkward.

<T><A3/3>Shh! Granny's a stickler for
service. I have to keep things
formal when she's in earshot!

<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A4/1>Oh, I see. Righto.

ready, I shall escort you to your
room.<W> Right this way, please!
