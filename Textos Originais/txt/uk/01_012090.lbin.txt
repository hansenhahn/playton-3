<T>This room's got the best view in
the whole hotel. Lucky for you that
it was available.
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>Did you hear that, Professor?
What a stroke of luck!
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>Yeah... Though come to think of it,
I suppose it's not really luck at all.
!******************************!
<T>We haven't had a single guest since
we moved the hotel to this new
location, you see.
!******************************!
<T>So the Hotel Duke used to be
located somewhere else?
!******************************!
<T><A4/4>Erm... It's a bit of a touchy
subject, so I'd rather not go into
it. I hope you understand...
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>Hey, I was really impressed with
the way you solved the puzzle that
Granny threw at you, you know.
!******************************!
<T>Well, I do like a good puzzle...
!******************************!
<T>Me too! How about this: solve this
puzzle for me, and I'll tell you how
to get to the station.
!******************************!
<T><A4/5>Hey, no backing out! You have to
solve my puzzle if you want me to
tell you where the station is.
!******************************!
<T>I'll be happy to tell you how to get
to the station if you solve this
puzzle!
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Nicely done!<W> Oh! I nearly forgot you
were trying to get to the station.
!******************************!
<T>It's not too far. Just keep going
east once you leave the hotel.
!******************************!
<T>You'll come out onto Flatstone
Street. Head north and the station
will be on your right.
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>Thanks, Becky. I think we'll be able
to find it now.
!******************************!
<T>Hey wait! One more thing.
!******************************!
<T>Hmm? What's that?
!******************************!
<T>It's a bit of a detour, but you
should drop by the arcade on your
way to the station.
!******************************!
<T>There's a restaurant there that's 
just scrumptious!
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>It's not a patch on the food we
serve here, of course, but it's not
half bad, you know?
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>The arcade? You mean that place
where the little boy is standing,
blocking the entrance?
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>Little boy? Oh, you must be
talking about Max.
!******************************!
<T>I've got him wrapped around my
little finger.
!******************************!
<T>Just let him know that Becky sent
you and he'll let you straight
through.
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>Ha ha! Good to know. Well, we might
as well go through the arcade and
see a bit more of the area.
!******************************!
