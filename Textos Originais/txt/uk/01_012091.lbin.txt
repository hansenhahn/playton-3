<T>You want to get to the station,
don't you?<W> Well, solve this puzzle
and I'll tell you how to get there.

<T><A4/5>Hey, no backing out! You have to
solve my puzzle if you want me to
tell you where the station is.
!******************************!
<HDR:83788362834C815B>
<T>I'll be happy to tell you how to get
to the station if you solve this
puzzle!
!******************************!
<HDR:83788362834C815B>
<T><A1/1>Nicely done! Oh! I nearly forgot
you were trying to get to the
station.
!******************************!
<HDR:83788362834C815B>
<T>It's not too far. Just head east
down Southern Street as you leave
the hotel.
!******************************!
<HDR:83788362834C815B>
<T>You'll soon come to Flatstone
Street. Head north up there and
the station will be on your right.

<T>Thanks Becky. I think we{9}ll
be able to find it now.
!******************************!
<HDR:83788362834C815B>
<T>Hey wait! One more thing.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Hmm? What's that?
!******************************!
<HDR:83788362834C815B>
<T>It's a bit of a detour, but you
should drop by the arcade on your
way to the station.
!******************************!
<HDR:83788362834C815B>
<T>There's a restaurant there that's 
just scrumptious!
!******************************!
<HDR:83788362834C815B>
<T><A1/5>It's not a patch on the food we
serve here, of course, but it's not
half bad, you know?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>The arcade? You mean that place
where the little boy is standing,
blocking the entrance?
!******************************!
<HDR:83788362834C815B>
<T><A2/2>Little boy? Oh, you must be talking
about Max.
!******************************!
<HDR:83788362834C815B>
<T>I've got him wrapped around my
little finger.
!******************************!
<HDR:83788362834C815B>
<T>Just let him know that Becky sent
you and he'll let you straight
through.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/2>Ha ha! Good to know. Well, we might
as well go through the arcade and
see a bit more of the area.
