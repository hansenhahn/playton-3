<T>Ah, young man! Do you have a
moment?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Hmm? Are you talking to me?
!******************************!
<HDR:837D815B834B838C83628367>
<T>I am indeed, er...Luke, was it?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>That's right!
What can I do for you?
!******************************!
<HDR:837D815B834B838C83628367>
<T>Oh, it's nothing terribly important.
It's just been a while since we had
a youngster like yourself here.
!******************************!
<HDR:837D815B834B838C83628367>
<T>That's why I thought I'd welcome
you with a gift.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A4/1>A gift? For me?
!******************************!
<HDR:837D815B834B838C83628367>
<T>That's right. These are all the
rage with the local children, I
hear.
!******************************!
<HDR:83788362834C815B>
<T>Oh, it's one of those toy cars!
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Do you have one too, Becky?
!******************************!
<HDR:83788362834C815B>
<T><A1/5>Me? Hah!<W> No way. I'm not into
kiddie toys like that.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/1>Oh.
!******************************!
<HDR:83788362834C815B>
<T><A1/2>Not that there's anything wrong
with having an interest in toys, of
course.
!******************************!
<HDR:83788362834C815B>
<T>I mean, that car is perfect for a
boy your age. You have fun with it
now!
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Um... Yeah, I'll try.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Don't look so glum, Luke. Collecting
miniature cars is a perfectly
respectable hobby for a gentleman.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A3/2>Yeah, that's right, Professor!
!******************************!
<HDR:83788362834C815B>
<T><A1/2>See? I told you.
