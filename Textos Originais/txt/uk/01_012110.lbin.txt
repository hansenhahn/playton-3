<T>Hi there. You're Max, aren't you?
!******************************!
<T>DING DING DING!<W> Correct!<W> But how
do you know my name?
!******************************!
<T>Becky told us.
!******************************!
<T><A3/0>BZZT!<W> Invalid answer!<W> <A1/2>So bossy
Becky sent you! You must be
staying at the hotel, then.
!******************************!
<T>DING!<W> Er... I mean, yes, we are.
!******************************!
<T>Hey, is the arcade through that
archway? And does it lead to the
station?
!******************************!
<T>DING DING DING!<W> Correct!<W> That's
the arcade all right! And you can
get to the station from there.
!******************************!
<T>Walk all the way through the arcade
and you'll come out onto a big
road called Flatstone Street.
!******************************!
<T>Then just head up Flatstone Street
and at the north end, you'll find
the station.
!******************************!
