<T>Sorry fellas, we're not open yet.
!******************************!
<T>Didn't you see the sign out the

!******************************!
<T>The sign seemed to indicate that

<T>That Max is a lost cause.

<T><A3/2>Sorry for the inconvenience. Would
you like to take a seat and wait?
We'll be ready before too long.
!******************************!
<T>I'm afraid we'll have to come back
later. We're in a bit of a rush at
the moment, you see.

<T><A2/5>Just as well, really. I've got a
mess on my hands that needs my
attention right now.
!******************************!
<T>What seems to be the problem?
!******************************!
<T>I can't open the back door.<W> The
missus set a new code for the lock

<T>Hey, you don't think you could work
out the code, do you? It would be a

!******************************!
<T>Cheers, fellas! Thanks to you, I

back for dinner - it's on the house!
!******************************!
<T>Sorry fellas, the kitchen's not
ready to start cooking yet.
