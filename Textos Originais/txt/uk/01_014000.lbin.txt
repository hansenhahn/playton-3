seeing you, but it's growing late.
We ought to be on our way.</V>
!******************************!
<V0020><T>Ah, busy as always, I see. Do drop
by again when you have the time,
won't you?</V>
!******************************!
<V0030><T>Oh, but before you go, I have
something of yours I should return.</V>

<T><V0031>I've been looking after her for
some time now, you see.</V>
!******************************!
<V0040><T>I won't be needing her any more,
so you can take her away. The old
dear's parked around back.</V>
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>I see. Thank you.

<T>It was a pleasant surprise to see
you today, Hershel.

<T>I know you're in a bit of a hurry,
but you should go out to the back 
of the building with those keys.
