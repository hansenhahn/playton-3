<T>Why...it appears to be my beloved
Laytonmobile.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>That's what I thought, too.<W> I've
never seen anyone else with such a
funny-shaped car, after all.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Funny-shaped?<W> I'll have you know
that this is a classic, my dear boy.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Judging by all the dust and dirt on
it, it must be.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>It doesn't look like anyone's been
taking care of your car while it's
been parked out here, Professor.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Indeed.<W><A3/1> It does appear to have
been exposed to the elements for
quite some time.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A3/2>Why don't we see if it still works?
We won't need to rely on the train
any more if it does.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>That's an excellent suggestion,
Luke.<W></T> <TW><K>Hmm?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A4>What's the matter, Professor?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/1>Someone's installed a peculiar lock
on the door. Who could have done
such a thing?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>The Laytonmobile's not going
anywhere unless we open this lock.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Let's get this vexing lock open so
we can try starting up the car.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A2/2>There we are. It's finally open.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>All right! Start her up, Professor!
