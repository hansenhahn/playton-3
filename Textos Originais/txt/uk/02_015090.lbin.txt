<T><A2/5>What do you want from me?<W> Don't
hurt me! Please, I'm b-<W30>b-<W30>begging you!
!******************************!
<T>What? Why are you scared of me?
!******************************!
<T>You?<W> No, it's your friend there
with the b-<W30>b-<W30>big hat!<W> <A4/5>Augh! He's
looking right at me!
!******************************!
<T>Please calm down, sir. I mean you
no harm. You must have me confused
with someone else.
!******************************!
<T>The only thing I want to know is the
location of the Gilded 7 Casino. It
is around here, isn't it?
!******************************!
<T>The casino?
!******************************!
<T><A5/1>Oh, I get it!<W> You're testing me!<W>
You want to see if Edgar's going to
spill the b-<W30>b-<W30>beans!
!******************************!
<T>And if I do, you're going to send me
on a one-way trip to nowhere!
!******************************!
<T>What are you talking about?
!******************************!
<T>Augh!<W> <A6/0>Somebody help meee!
!******************************!
<T>There he goes again...
!******************************!
<T>Poor fellow.<W> It sounds as though
he's had a run-in with someone who
looks like me.
!******************************!
<T>He's not the first person to react
strangely to your hat.
!******************************!
<T>Hmm. Yes, it seems my doppelg{:a}nger
has quite a fearsome reputation.
!******************************!
<T>Well... Maybe you should take your
hat off for the time being. Just to
avoid confusion, you know.
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Nonsense, Luke. A gentleman can't
very well walk around with a bare
head now, can he?
!******************************!
<T>Er... I suppose not.<W> Well, what's
our next move?
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>That girl from the hotel, Becky,
has been quite helpful. Let's try
asking her for directions.
