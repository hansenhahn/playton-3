<T>Hello, sir. Sorry to bother you 
mid-shift, but do you know where
the Gilded 7 Casino is?
!******************************!
<T>The Gilded 7?!<W> I ain't your dad or
nothing, but ain't you a bit young
to be hittin' the tables?
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>Oh, I'm not interested in gambling.
I'm just meeting someone there.
!******************************!
<T>Whatever your excuse is, you're
gonna have a hard time gettin' in.
!******************************!
<T>Boss Bostro hates kids, you see.
Can't stand 'em.
!******************************!
<T>He'll have your hide if he sees you
in his casino.<W> I'd stay away if I was
you.
!******************************!
<T>I see...
