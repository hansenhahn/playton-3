<T>Hey, listen to this! I came across a
brilliant puzzle the other day. Want
to hear it?
!******************************!
<T>A new puzzle, eh?<W> Where'd you find
it, Max?
!******************************!
<T>It's a secret. But if you solve the
puzzle, I'll tell you.<W> What do you
say? Want to try it?
!******************************!
<T>Sure!
!******************************!
<T><A3/0>BZZT!<W> <A2/3>Invalid answer!<W> Too bad. I've
got a big secret to spill if you can
get it right, you know.
!******************************!
<T>If you can beat this puzzle, I'll tell
you something really cool!
!******************************!
<T>DING DING DING!<W> Correct!
!******************************!
<T>So, where did you find that nice
puzzle? You are going to tell me
now, aren't you?
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>DING DING DING!<W> Correct!<W> I found
it by touching a suspicious-looking
spot.
!******************************!
<T>A suspicious-looking spot?
!******************************!
<T>DING DING DING!<W> Yeah, if something
looks a little fishy, just give it a
bit of a poke.
!******************************!
<T>If you're lucky, a hint coin or
puzzle will appear out of thin air!
!******************************!
<T>Wow!<W> That's amazing!
!******************************!
<T>Yeah. You need a sharp eye, though.
Those hidden items could be
anywhere.
!******************************!
<T>If you touch an area and something
happens, well...<W><A1/5>you could say that's
a good sign.
!******************************!
<T>What kind of thing might happen?
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>Oh you know, maybe you'll see a
splash of water or a puff of dust.
!******************************!
<T>If you see something like that,
touch that same spot again. You
never know what you might find...
!******************************!
<T>Touch anything that looks
suspicious. You might find
something interesting!
!******************************!
