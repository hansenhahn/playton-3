<HDR:8366838D8343>
<T>Hmph. And just where do you two
think you're going?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>We're on our way to meet someone
at the Gilded 7 Casino.
!******************************!
<HDR:8366838D8343>
<T>I see.<W> Going to the casino to {''}meet
someone{''}, are you?<W> Interesting.
Veeery interesting...
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Psst, Professor, I think this man
is trying to intimidate us.
!******************************!
<HDR:8366838D8343>
<T><A6/0>Stop that whispering, boy! I'm right
here, you know!
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Oops!<W> Um... Sorry, mister.
!******************************!
<HDR:8366838D8343>
<T><A3/1>Hmph.<W> Well, since you've apologised,
I suppose I can overlook your
rudeness this time.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I'm sorry to impose, sir, but would
you be so kind as to let us pass?
It's getting rather late.
!******************************!
<HDR:8366838D8343>
<T><A5/5>But of course, my good man.<W> As
soon as you solve this puzzle of
mine, that is.
!******************************!
<HDR:8366838D8343>
<T>Hmph. What's the matter? Has my
puzzle stumped you?
!******************************!
<HDR:8366838D8343>
<T>Back to pit your wits against my
puzzle, I see. Very well then.
Prepare yourself!
!******************************!
<HDR:8366838D8343>
<T><A2/5>Well done. You've proven yourself
worthy, so I will provide you with a
cryptic but valuable warning.
!******************************!
<HDR:8366838D8343>
<T><A2/6>Danger lurks about that hat of
yours. You'd best watch yourself
around here.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Why is everyone so fixated on my
hat? Do you know someone else
with a hat like mine?
!******************************!
<HDR:8366838D8343>
<T>If I told you, it would kill all the
suspense, wouldn't it? I'll leave
that little mystery for you.
