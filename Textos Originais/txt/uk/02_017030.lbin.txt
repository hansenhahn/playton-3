<T>Good evening, sir.<W> May I see your
membership card, please?
!******************************!
<T>Membership card?
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>The Gilded 7 Casino is a haven
where society's finest ladies and
gentlemen can gather.
!******************************!
<T>We check membership cards upon
entry to ensure that less savoury
types are kept out.
!******************************!
<T>Hmm... This is certainly the first
I've heard of such a policy.
!******************************!
<T>I don't suppose you'd be willing
to make an exception for us?
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>Well, your hat does show you to be
a man of impeccable taste. Now we
just need to test your intellect.
!******************************!
<T>If you can solve this puzzle, I'll let
you in without a card - just this
once, mind.
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>This fellow seems awfully focused
on your hat as well.
!******************************!
<T>Naturally. Is there any greater
proof of one's gentlemanly nature
than a fine top hat?
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>Come now, sir. Don't tell me
a gentleman of your calibre is
incapable of solving a quick puzzle.
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>Back to try again, sir?<W> <A2/2>Perhaps
you can find the correct answer
this time.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Expertly solved, sir.
!******************************!
<T>You've certainly earned the right
to enjoy our exclusive facilities.<W>
<A1/2>Welcome to the Gilded 7.
!******************************!
