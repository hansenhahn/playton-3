<T>Professor Layton, Luke, welcome
to the London of the future.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><K>Hmm.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>Still not convinced?
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>You saw Dr Schrader, didn't you?
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T><A1/4>You must have noticed the toll that
time has taken on your mentor.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Yes, we saw him...
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>And what of fair London? You've
walked around enough now to see
how she's changed.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>Could you imagine there being a
casino in this sleepy part of town
back in your time?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Yeah, everything's changed! What's
happened to this city?
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T><A1/5>A genius appeared...<W>an evil genius
who turned the city on its head.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/3>Oh, I know where this is going.<W>
Don Paolo took over the city,
didn't he?
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T><A1/1>Don Paolo?<W> <A1/4>Oh no, I'm talking about
a truly brilliant man.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>Someone the three of us all know
quite well.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A2/1>Well, if it's not Don Paolo, then
who is it?
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>What do you think, Professor?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I really couldn't say.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>Hmm... Really?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Who is it? I've just got to know!
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>His name is Hershel Layton.<W> The
evil genius is you, Professor.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/6>WHAAAAT?!
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I...<W>was afraid you'd say that.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>That can't possibly be right!
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>I'm sorry to say that it is.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>They call him {''}the devil in the top
hat{''}, and he rules London from the
shadows.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>It's common knowledge for people
in this part of London.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Tell me more, Luke.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/1>What? I don't know any more than
you do, Professor.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>No, I meant the other Luke.<W>
Goodness, this is getting rather
complicated, isn't it?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Tell me, Luke, how did I rise to rule
over all of London?
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>Where to begin...?<W> Here, Professor,
surely you remember this?
!******************************!
