<T>So where are we headed to now
then, um,<W> Mr Triton?
!******************************!
<T><A2/5>Luke, please call me anything but
Mr Triton. It's really strange
being called that by myself.
!******************************!
<T>It's pretty awkward for me too,
but what else am I supposed to call
you?
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>I don't see why you can't both be
called Luke.
!******************************!
<T>Should the need to distinguish
between you arise, you can be {''}Big
Luke{''}, and you can be {''}Little Luke{''}.
!******************************!
<T>I'm not too keen on {''}Little Luke{''},
but it's better than all this
confusion.
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>You're the boss, Professor.<W>
It's a pleasure to make your
acquaintance, Little Luke!
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Oh no, the pleasure is all mine,
Big Luke!
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Heh heh. Now, where were we?<W>
Ah yes. There was something I
needed to check up on.
!******************************!
<T>Professor, did you pass a
restaurant in the shopping
arcade on the way to the casino?
!******************************!
<T>The one near the arcade's southern
exit?
!******************************!
<T>That's the one. We'll head there
first. A friend of mine is waiting
for us.
!******************************!
