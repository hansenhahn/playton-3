<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>Sorry to keep you waiting, Shipley.
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>Not at all. I just got here a minute
ago myself.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>You've all met before, but I don't
think you were properly introduced.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>This is my good friend, Shipley.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>He has played a vital role in bringing
you and Little Luke here to our
time.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/2>Pleased to meet you, Shipley.
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>Likewise, Professor. Sorry I had
to be so brief with ya when we last
met.
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>Luke here told me I shouldn't share
any details until he had the chance
to speak to ya himself.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Don't give it another thought.
Luke needed to test us before
sharing the details of his plan.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>Shipley, did you manage to do some
reconnaissance work in Chinatown
as I asked?
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>Certainly did, Luke. That filthy
scumbag Layton-
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>Er, apologies, Professor. I'm
talking about the evil Layton, of
course.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>The professor is aware of the
situation. Do continue.
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>Right. Ya know the Towering Pagoda
in Chinatown?
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>Evil Layton is holding them captured
scientists there, apparently.
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>He's got them working like slaves
on something or other.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T><A1/4>So the scientists are in the
Towering Pagoda...<W> That's going
to make things very difficult.
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>I heard another peculiar rumour
while I was about town.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T><A1/1>Yes?
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>Word has it that the prime minister
who disappeared 10 years ago is
being held up there too.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T><A1/5>What?!
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A4/5>Bill Hawks...
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A4/1>He's been missing ever since the
day of the accident.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T><A3/5>It's been 10 years now...
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>Do you suppose evil Layton might
have abducted the prime minister
as well as all those scientists?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>We won't know until we check the
facts for ourselves.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/1>Big Luke, you seemed apprehensive
at the mention of the Towering
Pagoda.<W> What is this place?
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>The Towering Pagoda is the Family
stronghold, situated among a sea
of warehouses in Chinatown.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>To complicate matters, all of
Chinatown is under Family control.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>Which means it'll be difficult just
to get within walking distance.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Be that as it may, we need to
uncover the truth.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Can you guide us safely to the
pagoda?
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T><A1/1>Hmm... Infiltrating a place like
that is going to require a bit of
preparation.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>Why don't we split up for a bit and
I'll see if I can secure us a safe
route there?
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>You go on and head for Chinatown
without me. Shipley will tell you how
to get that far. All right?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Very well.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>Good. Now I need to get moving. Be
careful out there.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Crikey, he didn't half leave in a
hurry.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>We need to get to Chinatown,
Shipley. What's the best way
to get there?
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>Let's see... Yer best bet is to
head back up Flatstone Street.
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>As ya head north towards the
casino, there's a small set of
stairs on the right.
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>Do ya know the ones I mean?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Ah, yes. Now that you mention it, I
do recall passing by an area that
fits that description.
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>Good. Head up them stairs and
follow the narrow alley at the top
until ya hit a path above the river.
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>From there, just follow that path
and it'll take ya straight into
Chinatown.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>You're not coming with us, Shipley?
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>I wish I could, but I've got to stay
here and wait for word from yer
older self.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Very well. Thank you for your
assistance, Shipley.<W> Come, Luke.
We mustn't tarry here.
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>Be careful out there! If ya run
into any trouble, ya can always
find me here.
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>To get to Chinatown, head north up
Flatstone Street.
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>Then climb the stairs on the right
and go down the alley at the top.
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>After a while, ye'll come to a path
above the river. Follow that path
to get to Chinatown.
!******************************!
