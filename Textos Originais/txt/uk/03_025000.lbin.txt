<K><T>Hmm...
!******************************!
<T>Did you see that, Professor? That
was the same woman we saw earlier,
wasn't it?
!******************************!
<T>I... I suppose it was.
!******************************!
<T>You seem distracted, Professor.
Are you all right?
!******************************!
<T>What's that?<W> Oh, I'm fine, Luke.
Absolutely fine.
!******************************!
<T>If you say so, Professor.<W> Hey
look, I bet these are the stairs
Shipley mentioned.
!******************************!
<T><A4/5>I could've sworn that was Claire.<W>
But that's impossible...
!******************************!
<T>Word has it that the prime minister
who disappeared 10 years ago is
being held up there too.
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Perhaps that's what happened when
the prime minister was abducted 10
years ago...
!******************************!
<T>Perhaps he was sent to the future,
as we were...<W> What if all this talk
of time travel is real?
!******************************!
<T>If so, then maybe that really was
Claire...
!******************************!
<T>No! It defies all logic. Claire can't
be here. Not after that day...
