<T>Do you suppose that bronze statue
depicts some sort of local hero?<W>
I'm going to have a quick look.
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Huh? Look, Professor, the man in
the statue has the same hat as you!
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>Ha ha! So he does!<W> If I'm the man
in the statue, does that make you
that boy there?
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Hmm, well, I suppose he looks a bit
like me...
!******************************!
<T>Oh, there's a description of the 
statue here. Let's see...
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>It seems our friend here was some
sort of famous author.
!******************************!
<T>An author, you say? Not a
professor?
!******************************!
<T>Imagine if he was! Now that would
be a coincidence!<W> Let's see what
else it says.
!******************************!
<T>The author used to write big,
complicated books. But all that
changed because of this boy.
!******************************!
<T>The boy was ill, and to cheer him up,
the man wrote an adventure novel
for people of all ages.
!******************************!
<T>I suppose the book was so
successful that he went on to
write more of them.
!******************************!
<T>What a heart-warming story.
!******************************!
<T>Oh, but that's not all, Professor.
Here, I'll read you the rest.
!******************************!
<T><CR>{''}In the end, the little boy was
taken by his illness.
!******************************!
<T><CR>However, the extraordinary
friendship between the author and
the boy would last forever.{''}</C>
!******************************!
<T><A1/4>I can't believe how sad that ending
is.
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>There, there. It's not all bad, my
boy. It sounds as if the two found
true friendship in each other.
!******************************!
<T>Some people go through their whole
lives without experiencing such a
thing.
!******************************!
<T>I suppose so.<W> It's still terribly
sad, though.
!******************************!
<T>Look here. It says, <CR>{''}In memory of
an extraordinary and everlasting
friendship.{''}</C>
!******************************!
<T>Wouldn't it be wonderful if our
friendship grew to those heights?
!******************************!
<T><A1/3>What do you mean, {''}if{''}?!<W> Our
friendship is already extraordinary
and everlasting.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Now, now, Luke. I didn't mean to
ruffle your feathers. You're right.
We're very good friends.
!******************************!
<T>You're not upset, are you?
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>Me? Upset? Of course not.<W> Anyway,
I think we should move on.
!******************************!
<T>Oh dear...
!******************************!
