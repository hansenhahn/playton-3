<T><A1/4>Hello there, little chappie.
Have you ever been so bored you
could keel over?<W> Me too.
!******************************!
<T>Why are you so bored?
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>Well, I don't have anything to do.
That's a big factor.
!******************************!
<T>But also, I've sort of lost my life,
and now I can't find it.
!******************************!
<T>Uh... How does one lose one's life?
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>A while back, this fella tells me I
can earn a few bob doing this cushy
job.
!******************************!
<T>I was out of work at the time, so
I thought, why not, you know?
!******************************!
<T>Makes sense.
!******************************!
<T>Yeah, I thought so too, until I
realised I'd been had.
!******************************!
<T>Fella threw me in a dark hole and
had me digging all day and night.
Working like a dog, I was.
!******************************!
<T><A4/4>It sounds like whatever he was
paying you, it wasn't worth it.
!******************************!
<T><A2/5>I haven't even told you the worst
bit yet! I finally finish the job and
I head home, yeah?
!******************************!
<T>But everything's been switched
around while I'm in the hole, and
I can't find my house or my family!
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>Oh gosh! Maybe you travelled
through time like us!
!******************************!
<T>Who what where now? <W>I don't really
follow, but I do know I've been out
here on my own for a while.
!******************************!
<T>The only thing I've got to pass the
time are these puzzles I do.<W> Here,
try one.
!******************************!
<T>No luck?<W> Don't feel bad, chappie.
You can always come back and try
again. I'm not going anywhere...
!******************************!
<T>Let me guess. You've got nothing
to do.<W> Me neither. Why don't you
pass the time with a puzzle?
!******************************!
<T>Good job there, chappie. I can tell
you're a thinker.
!******************************!
<T>You remind me of my son. A right
know-it-all, he is, but he's a good
boy really.
!******************************!
<T>He used to love it when I'd give him
a puzzle to work on. I do wish I
could see the little tyke again.
!******************************!
<T>I wish I could find my way back
home. It'd be nice to see the family
again.
!******************************!
