<T>Good day, fine gents. Isn't the view
from here absolutely glorious?
!******************************!
<T>It most certainly is, sir.
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>Truly, it's nothing short of
breathtaking.
!******************************!
<T>Psst, Professor. Look at this man.
Do you suppose he could be part of
the Family?
!******************************!
<T><A2/3>What's that, boy? I'm standing
right here! If you have something
to say, say it to my face!
!******************************!
<T>What's more, I don't appreciate
being associated with those drably
clad ruffians.
!******************************!
<T>Look at this suit! See the
stitching? This was custom-made
in Italy!<W> Italy, I say!
!******************************!
<T><A1/6>I'm ever so sorry, sir. I meant no
offence! I never thought you were
one of them really.
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>Well, as long as you acknowledge
your outrageous mistake, I'm willing
to let bygones be bygones.
!******************************!
<T>Just to assuage any lingering
doubts as to my identity, however,
allow me to introduce myself.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Before you stands London's most
distinguished, dashing and debonair
man.<W> <A4/5>The name's Graham.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>I would tell you to remember the
name, but I know you can't possibly
forget!
!******************************!
<T>Got it! Graham, London's most
distinguished, dashing and, um...
I forgot the last one.
!******************************!
<T>But I won't forget the name, I
promise!
!******************************!
<T>Graham's the name. Those in search
of London's most debonair man
need look no further!
