<T>Oh, hullo there.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Say, do you happen to know if this
is the way to Chinatown?
!******************************!
<HDR:834E838C8343834F>
<T>Ah reckon this path'll most likely
take ye there, aye.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>You reckon? Haven't you taken
this path before?
!******************************!
<HDR:834E838C8343834F>
<T><A1/3>Nae chance! Ah've a feeling
something could happen tae me
doon that way. Something bad.
!******************************!
<HDR:834E838C8343834F>
<T>Like, Ah could get intae a rammy
with that Family lot.
!******************************!
<HDR:834E838C8343834F>
<T>Ah'm better off jist staying here
and solving puzzles.
!******************************!
<HDR:834E838C8343834F>
<T>Aye, it's a tough one, eh?
!******************************!
<HDR:834E838C8343834F>
<T>Ah don't think ye should be going
doon there then.
!******************************!
<HDR:834E838C8343834F>
<T>Ye'll need to prove that yer on the
ball by solving that wee puzzle
first.
!******************************!
<HDR:834E838C8343834F>
<T>Ah've a feeling that Chinatown
place is bad news. Much safer tae
stay here and do a bit of puzzling.
!******************************!
<HDR:834E838C8343834F>
<T>Huh, ye've solved ma puzzle. Looks
like yer nae part of that Family lot
then. They're not too bright, see.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Of course not! We're no Family
minions! I'm Luke, and this here
is the famous Professor Layton!
!******************************!
<HDR:834E838C8343834F>
<T><A2/8>Whit?!<W> L-Layton, ye say? Course
he's not a Family minion!<W> He's the
head honcho!
!******************************!
<HDR:834E838C8343834F>
<T>Help! Somebody help me!
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Oops. I forgot how the name
Layton scares the living daylights
out of people in this time.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Yes, it's unfortunate, but people
do seem to think I'm a criminal.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>On a more interesting note, have
a look at the ground, Luke.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Those footprints must belong to
the man who just ran off.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Come to think of it, his shoes and
trousers were soaking. But why?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>It's a bit chilly to go out for a
swim, don't you think?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Indeed. So how did he get so wet?
Hmm...
