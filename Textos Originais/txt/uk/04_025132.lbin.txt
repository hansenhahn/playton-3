<T>Oh, that must be the bird that
fellow is talking about.
!******************************!
<T>Oh wow! A parrot!
!******************************!
<T><A2/3>Don't just stand there staring!
Grab the winged menace before it
flaps off!
!******************************!
<T><A1/4>You may not have noticed, sir, but
we're in a bit of a hurry here.
!******************************!
<T>Luke, listen to yourself! Don't you
remember what the professor
always says? 
!******************************!
<T>Helping people in need is the duty
of every gentleman.
!******************************!
<T>A very good point, Luke.<W> <A1/1>Very well
then, let's think. This bird clearly
likes shiny objects.
!******************************!
<T>Excuse me sir, would you happen to
have anything shiny we could
borrow for a moment?
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>Of course! What sort of gentleman
would I be without the proper
accoutrements?
!******************************!
<T>Here, I always carry a garnet for
when I need to accessorise with a
little flash!
!******************************!
<T><A3/4>Oh...<W> Oh dear.
!******************************!
<T>What's wrong?
!******************************!
<T>Curses! The garnet has fallen to
the bottom of my case and I can't
reach it!
!******************************!
<T><A4/4>You're not making it very easy for
us to help you.
!******************************!
<T>He really should sort out the
contents of this briefcase
sometime. It's a bit of a mess.
!******************************!
<T>Let me see if I can retrieve that
garnet this time.
!******************************!
<T>Aha! There we are!
!******************************!
<T>With any luck, this flashy gem will
attract the parrot.
!******************************!
<T>See if you can tame him when he
gets close.
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Leave it to me!
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>Right then. Here goes!
!******************************!
<T>Awwwrk!
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>Here he comes!
!******************************!
<T>Awwwrk! Skwaaarka skwaaaawk!
!******************************!
<T><A1/6>Don't worry, boy! We won't
hurt you!
!******************************!
<T>Skwawk! Skwaaaark!
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>You don't say!
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>You know, that bird seems pretty
fond of you, Luke. Are you friends
now?
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>Of course!
!******************************!
<T>Well, now that you're friends, why
don't you give him a name?
!******************************!
<T>Good idea, Professor! But what
should I name him? Hmm...
!******************************!
<T>Hallo, hallo! Nice to meetchoo,
meetchoo! I'm <N1>!
!******************************!
<T>Hello there! I'm Luke.<W> It's nice to
meet you too, <N1>!
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>Nice work, Luke! That was amazing!
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>Of course! What else would you
expect from the apprentice of the
great Professor Layton?
!******************************!
