<T><A1/1>Thank goodness you caught that
fluffy fiend. What fine young men
you two are!
!******************************!
<T>Keep at it and one day you will each
become a true gentleman, just like
myself.
!******************************!
<T>Glad we could help.<W> Here's your
garnet and...I believe these
cufflinks are yours too.
!******************************!
<T>Oh, yes.<W> There we are. With these
in place I'm even more devastatingly
handsome than before.
!******************************!
<T>Now I believe you two young men
deserve something for your
trouble.
!******************************!
<T>Oh, there's really no need, sir.
!******************************!
<T>Helping people is reward enough
for any gentleman!
