<T><A1/5>Today's the big day! At last, I shall
propose to the most enchanting
woman in all of London.
!******************************!
<T>Propose a business partnership,
that is!
!******************************!
<T>Gosh, how exciting!
!******************************!
<T><A3/4>Oh yes. At last Belle, radiant
goddess that she is, will help me
realise my life's ambition!
!******************************!
<T>I plan to start...<W>a clothing line!
!******************************!
<T>As you can see, I am no stranger
to style myself.
!******************************!
<T>But no one has their finger on the
pulse of fashion like that girl.
!******************************!
<T>Every genius needs a muse. Belle is
mine!
!******************************!
<T>Oh...<W> Well, um, good luck with that.
!******************************!
<T>Perhaps a new cravat is what I
need to seal the deal. Hmm...
