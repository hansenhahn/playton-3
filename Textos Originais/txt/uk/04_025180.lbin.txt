<T><A1/6>Augh! What are you doing hiding
there?!
!******************************!
<HDR:8354837D838A815B>
<T>I see you've learned the secret
knock, dearie.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>Actually, I was the one who did the
knocking, Spring. Is Cogg around?
!******************************!
<HDR:8354837D838A815B>
<T>Ah, there you are, Luke. Cogg's in
the back room.

<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/1>Oh, so you know the owners of
the clock shop, Luke?

<T><A2/5>I must have forgotten to mention
that earlier, but yes, Spring and
Cogg have been helping me.

<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>I think Cogg can explain better
than I can, though. You should ask
him.

<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>All right.<W><A4/1> Let's hear what he
has to say.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>Cogg's in the back room. He'll fill
you in on how all this time travelling
began.

<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>Sorry for keeping you in the dark.
It was never my intention to
deceive you.
