<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>I thought I heard voices out front.
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>Nice to see you again, Professor
and er...
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A3/2>Luke! The professor's apprentice!
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T><A2/1>Yes, yes, Luke, of course.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>Would you mind telling them about
the wormhole and how it all
started, Cogg?
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>I think it would help to have
everyone on the same page.
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>It'd be my pleasure.<W> Now then, Luke!
Erm...<W>the smaller Luke, that is.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A3/1>Yes?
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>Tell me, lad. What does this
contraption behind me look like
to you?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>A big, old clock.
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>Right you are. By my estimate, this
clock is well over a hundred years
old.
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>The old girl needs a lot of TLC to
keep chugging along, so I spend
quite a bit of time on maintenance.
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>I was right in the middle of oiling
her gears one day when two Family
thugs burst in...
!******************************!
<HDR:8353838D8362834C815B>
<T>Here we go. This has gotta be the
place the boss was talkin' about.
!******************************!
<HDR:8373838983938360>
<T>Too right. Hey, boss! There's a big
clock here, just like you said. It's
a proper antique, look!
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T><A1/1>Hey you! What do you think you're
doing, barging into my shop? Get
your hands off my clock!
!******************************!
<HDR:8353838D8362834C815B>
<T>Shut it, you old codger! You don't
tell us what to do. Don't you know
who you're dealin' with?
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>I'm dealing with a load of clods
who won't get out of my shop!
!******************************!
<HDR:8373838983938360>
<T><A3/3>I'd keep a civil tongue in my head
if I were you, grandad.
!******************************!
<HDR:8373838983938360>
<T>Now get outta the way! We've got a
schedule to keep here.
!******************************!
<HDR:837B83588367838D>
<T><A4/0>What are you clowns waitin'
for? Get to work!
!******************************!
<HDR:837B83588367838D>
<T><A2/3>If we don't get a move on, things
won't be ready in time for
you-know-who!
!******************************!
<HDR:8353838D8362834C815B>
<T>Sorry boss, we're doin' our best,
but grandad here's got his
knickers in a twist.
!******************************!
<HDR:837B83588367838D>
<T>Then throw 'im out into the street,
you numpty!
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>Let me go, you villains!
!******************************!
<HDR:8373838983938360>
<T>We're just gonna go for a little
walk, all right, grandad?
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>You keep your filthy hands off
my clock! You hear me?
!******************************!
<HDR:837B83588367838D>
<T>We're just about on schedule.
!******************************!
<HDR:837B83588367838D>
<T>But we 'ave to wait until the exact
time the boss said to turn this
thing on.
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T><A2/1>That's all I heard before those
brutes threw me out of my own shop.
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>It wasn't until later that I found
out what the thugs wanted from
my little clock shop.
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>See, the Family was funding the
construction of a time machine
by a group of scientists.
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>I think the idea was to use it to
create some kind of wormhole.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>But how could they do that?
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>Search me. It was all mumbo-jumbo.
Something about opening up a
vortex in the flow of time.
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>Anyway, things didn't go exactly to
plan, for whatever reason.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I see. So...somehow this hole in
time appeared in this clock of
yours.
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>That's more or less it. This clock
has been ticking away for over
a hundred years.
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>My guess is that something about
the clock's age caused the warp
point to gravitate to this spot.
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>The wormhole, or whatever
it's called, became a part of my
clock.
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>The thing is, I'm the only one who
can keep the old girl running.
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>Which means, like it or not, I'm the
only person who can open and close
the wormhole.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A4/1>Wow, that's really weird!
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>It's a burden, is what it is.
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>Once the Family realised, they
forced me to work the clock for
them.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T><A1/2>After a while, I caught wind of
Cogg's situation.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>It goes without saying that he's
not a member of the Family.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>In fact, the Family's been nothing
but a source of trouble for him.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>It certainly sounds like it.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>So I approached Cogg and Spring
and explained my plan to them.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>They agreed to help, and Cogg fired
up the machine so that I could get
my message to you.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>And upon receiving your letter, I
let my curiosity take Luke and
myself on a journey that led here.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>That's quite a plan you concocted,
Big Luke.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T><A1/1>Thank you... But it's about to get
even more interesting.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A4/1>Oh?
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>Professor, with Cogg's help we can
send you and Luke back to your own
time.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>You'll be able to speak to Inspector
Chelmey there.

!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T><A1/4>But you will come back to put a
stop to what's going on here when
you've finished, won't you?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/2>You of all people should know the
answer to that question, Luke.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I keep my promises and I intend
to solve the problem here. It's
what a gentleman would do.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>Thank you, Professor. That was
exactly the answer I was hoping
for.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I wouldn't dream of leaving things
here in this state.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>You said it yourself, Luke. The only
one who can stop Hershel Layton is
Hershel Layton himself.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T><A2/2>Ha ha! That's true. My apologies.
I should never have doubted you.
!******************************!
