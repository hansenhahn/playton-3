<T>Let me see here. Yep, you've
solved at least 30 puzzles.
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>Seems you've done enough research
to take your investigation back to
your own time.
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>Hopefully, you'll learn something
there that will help us clear up the
terrible situation here.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Yes, I hope so. Now then, Cogg, if
you would be so kind as to start
up the clock...

<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>I hope you'll understand if I stay
here.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>I don't wish to risk distorting the
events of the past any more than
necessary.

<HDR:838C834383678393>

<T>Besides which, the poor inspector's
eyes would likely pop out of his head
if I turned up with two Lukes.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Wow, that actually sounds quite
funny... Too bad you can't come,
Big Luke.
!******************************!
<HDR:835783838362834E>
<T>Okay, she's all ready to go.<W>
<A3/0>Let's get going!
