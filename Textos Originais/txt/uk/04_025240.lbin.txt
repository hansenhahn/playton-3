<T>There's no doubt about it,
Professor. We're back in our time.

<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>The surroundings here certainly
do seem familiar.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Phew. All this time travel has
really worn me out, you know.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/2>Yes, I could do with a rest myself.
But we mustn't keep Cogg waiting.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A4/2>You're right. So, shall we go and
find Inspector Chelmey?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>That will be our second stop.
I'd like to drop by my office at
the university first.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>For a quick rest?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A2/2>Not quite. I need to check a few
things before our meeting with
Inspector Chelmey.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Preparation, my boy, is the
foundation upon which every good
investigation is built.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A4/2>Right you are, Professor!
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A4/2>Now that we're back in our own
time, we can reach the university
in a matter of minutes by bus.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Let's go, Luke.
