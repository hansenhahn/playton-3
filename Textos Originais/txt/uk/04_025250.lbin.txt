!******************************!
<T><A2/1>I just thought I'd give you some
advice, is all.
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>All right. What is it?
!******************************!
<T>Not many folks know this, but when
you solve puzzles, you can earn

!******************************!
<T><A4/1>Oh, if you're going to talk about
picarats, we already know all
about them.
