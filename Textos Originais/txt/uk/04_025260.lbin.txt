<T>Hi there, squirt. What can I do
for you?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>I noticed there's a bus stop up
ahead. London still has a bus
service, doesn't it?
!******************************!
<HDR:8366837283628367>
<T>Of course! We've got more buses
than you can shake a stick at.<W>
What an odd question.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A3/2>Brilliant!<W> Did you hear that,
Professor? The buses are running!
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A4/2>I heard, Luke.<W> Your exuberance
is appreciated, but we don't want
to unsettle our friend here.
!******************************!
<HDR:8366837283628367>
<T>Crikey, I've never seen someone
so chuffed about taking the bus.
!******************************!
<HDR:8366837283628367>
<T><A3/5>Well, if you like buses, you're going
to love this little number.
!******************************!
<HDR:8366837283628367>
<T>You know, if you really like buses,
solving a puzzle like this should be
a breeze.
!******************************!
<HDR:8366837283628367>
<T>Back to take my bus puzzle out for
another spin, eh?
!******************************!
<HDR:8366837283628367>
<T>You know, I'm something of a bus
aficionado myself.
!******************************!
<HDR:8366837283628367>
<T>The old double-deckers, mind. None
of that bendy business.
!******************************!
<HDR:8366837283628367>
<T>Did you manage to get a bus?
!******************************!
