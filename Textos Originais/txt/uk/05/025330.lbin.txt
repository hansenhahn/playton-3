<T>There you are, Professor L! I see
you've cancelled our lecture again
this week.
!******************************!
[hdr:000a0000000200000000025c000000]
[inf:838d835b8362835e]
<T>Let me guess, you're off
investigating another strange
mystery, aren't you?
!******************************!
[hdr:000a00000002ab00000002b4000000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T><A4/1>Ah, Miss Stone. Hello there.
Yes, I'm afraid that something
rather pressing has come up.
!******************************!
[hdr:000a00000002ab0000000216010000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T>I'll be holding supplementary
lectures later, though. You can
be sure of it.

[hdr:000a00000002000000000266010000]
[inf:838d835b8362835e]
<T>Oh, no worries, Professor L. As
long as I get the credits, I don't
really care.
!******************************!
[hdr:000a00000002ab00000002b9010000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T>Now, what kind of attitude is that,
Rosetta?
!******************************!
[hdr:000a00000002ab00000002e9010000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T>If you want those credits, you'll
have to earn them.

[inf:838c834383678393]
<T><A4/2>And since your topic is the stone
relics of Cornwall, I'd say you
have your work cut out for you.
!******************************!
[hdr:000a00000002ab000000028c020000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T>As your supervisor, I insist that
you check in with me weekly until
your dissertation is up to scratch.

[hdr:000a000000020000000002f7020000]
[inf:838d835b8362835e]
<T>Heh heh! I didn't mean to imply that
I wasn't interested in my studies.
!******************************!
[hdr:000a00000002000000000242030000]
[inf:838d835b8362835e]
<T>And I'm very much looking forward
to our...sessions together.

<T><A3/5>Not every girl has the privilege of
receiving private tuition from the
great Professor Layton.

[hdr:000a00000002ab00000002eb030000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T><A3/1>Erm.<W> Ahem.<W> What I meant was that
you should check in with me during
office hours.
!******************************!
[hdr:000a0000000200000000024c040000]
[inf:838d835b8362835e]
<T><A2/2>Oh, you don't have to tell me twice,
Professor L. I'll see you next
week.<W> Heh heh!
!******************************!
[hdr:001400000002ab04000002b2040000]
[inf:838b815b834e]
<T><A1/5>I don't know what that girl's up to,
but it can't be good, Professor!
!******************************!
[hdr:001400000002ab0000000201050000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T>Nonsense, my boy.<W> It's all in your
head.
!******************************!
[hdr:001400000002ab0400000230050000]
[inf:838b815b834e]
<T>You can't fool me. Did you see the
look she gave you? She's a...<W>a...<W>
maneater!<W> Whatever that means...
!******************************!

some mystery, aren't you,
Professor L?
