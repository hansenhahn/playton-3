<T>I suppose we have to head back to
future London now, don't we?

<T>What's the matter, Luke? Are you
scared of travelling through time
again?

[hdr:000a0000000200000000029f000000]
[inf:838b815b834e]
<T>Yes...<W> I mean, no. As long as I
don't have to do it alone.

<T><A1/2>Of course not. I'll be right
here with you.

<T>Our first step is to head to
Chinatown to meet the future
Professor Layton, I suppose?

<T><A4/1>That's right. If my assumptions
are correct, we'll find the prime
minister there as well.

<T>Do you think we'll run into trouble
along the way?

<T>Considering the warm welcome we
received from the Family at the
casino, I'd say anything's possible.

<T>Luke, there's no telling what kind
of dangers await us in the future.

<T>Maybe it would be best for you to
remain here in our time.

<T><A1/3>What kind of apprentice would I be
if I left you to face those dangers
all alone?

<T>I'm coming with you, Professor.
Let's go!
