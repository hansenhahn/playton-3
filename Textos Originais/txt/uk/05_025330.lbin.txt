<T>There you are, Professor L! I see
you've cancelled our lecture again
this week.
!******************************!
<T>Let me guess, you're off
investigating another strange
mystery, aren't you?
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>Ah, Miss Stone. Hello there.
Yes, I'm afraid that something
rather pressing has come up.
!******************************!
<T>I'll be holding supplementary
lectures later, though. You can
be sure of it.
!******************************!
<T>Oh, no worries, Professor L. As
long as I get the credits, I don't
really care.
!******************************!
<T>Now, what kind of attitude is that,
Rosetta?
!******************************!
<T>If you want those credits, you'll
have to earn them.
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>And since your topic is the stone
relics of Cornwall, I'd say you
have your work cut out for you.
!******************************!
<T>As your supervisor, I insist that
you check in with me weekly until
your dissertation is up to scratch.
!******************************!
<T>Heh heh! I didn't mean to imply that
I wasn't interested in my studies.
!******************************!
<T>And I'm very much looking forward
to our...sessions together.
!******************************!
<T><A3/5>Not every girl has the privilege of
receiving private tuition from the
great Professor Layton.
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Erm.<W> Ahem.<W> What I meant was that
you should check in with me during
office hours.
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>Oh, you don't have to tell me twice,
Professor L. I'll see you next
week.<W> Heh heh!
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>I don't know what that girl's up to,
but it can't be good, Professor!
!******************************!
<T>Nonsense, my boy.<W> It's all in your
head.
!******************************!
<T>You can't fool me. Did you see the
look she gave you? She's a...<W>a...<W>
maneater!<W> Whatever that means...
!******************************!
<T><A5/1>Oh dear...
!******************************!
<T>Heh heh!<W><A2/2> You're always off chasing
some mystery, aren't you,
Professor L?
!******************************!
