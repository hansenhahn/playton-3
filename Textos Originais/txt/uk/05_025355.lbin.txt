<T>What's done is done, so I guess
there's no point in dwelling on it.
!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T>You two must be awfully tired
after all that running around.
!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T>I just made a pot of tea. I'll go
fetch it.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A4/4>Um, Professor... Did you just make
a promise to Flora?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Yes, I'm rather afraid I did... And
unfortunately, this is one promise
I may have to break.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/3>Professor, that's terrible! You're
always saying that a gentleman
never breaks his word.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Well, I didn't see you doing anything
to dissuade the poor girl from
coming with us, Luke.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Besides, you know our current case
is fraught with danger. I don't
want her to get hurt.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>We need to finish what we came here
to do so that we can find the
inspector. We'd best move quickly.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/1>I suppose you're right, Professor.<W>
So, what are we looking for?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Somewhere in my office is a
leather-bound notebook with a
yellow note sticking out of it.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Do you think you can help me find it?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A3/2>Aye aye, Professor. I'm on the case!
