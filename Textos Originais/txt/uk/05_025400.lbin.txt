<T>All that stuff in your notebook,
Professor...
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838B815B834E8251>
<T>What was this explosion you were
researching? 
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838C8343836783938251>
<T>It all happened quite a few years
ago, when you were very small.
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838C8343836783938251>
<T>Two scientists working in a physics
lab accidentally caused an
explosion during an experiment.
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838C8343836783938251>
<T>The blast devastated the
surrounding area.
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838B815B834E8251>
<T>That must have been all over the
news.
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838C8343836783938251>
<T>You'd think so, wouldn't you?
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838C8343836783938251>
<T>However, though many perished in
the blast, few records of the
accident remain.
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838B815B834E8251>
<T>What happened?
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838C8343836783938251>
<T>That's something I'm still trying to
work out myself.
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838C8343836783938251>
<T>But answer me this, Luke: what is
the first thing that comes to mind
when you think of an explosion?
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838B815B834E8251>
<T>Why, the explosion at the
presentation of Dr Stahngun's
time machine, of course!
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838C8343836783938251>
<T>That was my first thought as well.
I have a strong suspicion that
these two incidents are connected.
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838B815B834E8251>
<T>Why's that?
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838C8343836783938251>
<T>Well, it's nothing more than a hunch
at the moment, so I can't really
say any more.
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838B815B834E8251>
<T><K>Hmm...
!******************************!
<HDR:4F50838B815B834E8251>
<T>Oh, Professor, this is our stop!
!******************************!
