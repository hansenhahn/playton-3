<T>Ahh... Nothing like a nice cup of
tea to soothe the nerves.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Good day, Barton.
!******************************!
<HDR:836F815B83678393>
<T><A1/1>Oh! Er... Good day to you, sir.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Barton, we wish to have a few
words with the inspector, but
I don't see him here.
!******************************!
<HDR:836F815B83678393>
<T>I don't see him here either.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I was led to believe he was here in
his office...
!******************************!
<HDR:836F815B83678393>
<T>Yes, he was. Then he got up and left.<W>
It was all very sudden.
!******************************!
<HDR:836F815B83678393>
<T><K>...</K><W>I am puzzled by his sudden
disappearance.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T><A5/0>Barton! I sincerely hope you're
not spreading misinformation
about me!
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T><A1/1>It wasn't five minutes ago I told
you I needed to pop downstairs
to see the chief constable.
!******************************!
<HDR:836F815B83678393>
<T>Oh yes. You did say that, sir.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T><A1/5>Use your ears, Constable. You'll
never move up in the force if
you don't learn to listen.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Hello Inspector.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T><A3/1>Ah, sorry about that, Layton.
What a surprise to see you.<W>
Welcome to my humble office.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Forgive the sudden intrusion,
Inspector.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I heard that you're leading the
investigation into the prime
minister's disappearance.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T><A2/6>I am.<W> And since it's you I'm speaking
to, I'll be quite candid. This case
has me baffled. 
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T>Dozens of eyewitnesses, myself
included, and not one blasted lead
to work with!
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><K>Hmm...
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T>Since you were there too, I might
as well hear your take on things.<W>
Have a seat.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I was interviewed on the day of the
incident, but maybe another chat
will uncover some new theories.
!******************************!
<HDR:836F815B83678393>
<T>I fear the inspector may be quite
angry with me at the moment.
!******************************!
