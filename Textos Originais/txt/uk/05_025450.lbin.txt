<T>We've already established that
you were there when the explosion
occurred.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Yes, I certainly was.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T>Then you must believe, as I do, that
there's no way anyone could have
survived that blast.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T>Not that quack Stahngun, not his
staff and, though I hate to say
it, not the prime minister.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T>But what confounds me is that we
haven't found a single trace of
any of them.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>What do you mean?
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T><A1/5>We went through the place with a
fine-tooth comb and didn't find
anything related to the victims.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T>No bodies, no clothing and no shoes.
Not even so much as a pocket watch
or ring!
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T>All we recovered from the scene
was the 10 tons of scrap metal
that used to be the machine.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T>No people.
!******************************!
<HDR:836F815B83678393>
<T>There were eight of them, sir.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T>What? Did you just say something,
Constable?
!******************************!
<HDR:836F815B83678393>
<T>There were eight of them, sir.
Eight people vanished.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T><A2/1>Ah, yes. According to eyewitness
reports, eight people vanished from
the scene.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T>That group consisted of Stahngun,
a handful of his assistants and the
prime minister.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T>Now, how in the world do eight
people just vanish? It's like a
blasted magic trick!
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Don't worry, Inspector. From what
I've heard, the prime minister is
still alive!
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T><A2/5><K>Hmm?<W></K><A2/1> Ah, young Luke. Be a good lad
and keep quiet, all right?
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T>The adults are having a serious
conversation here.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T>If you're bored, why don't you and
Barton go and play in the lobby?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Inspector, I assure you Luke isn't
making this up. There's a very real
possibility that Bill Hawks is alive.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T><A2/5>What?!<W> Well, don't leave me here
scratching my head like a fool!
Explain yourself, Layton.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I will, but I must ask a favour of
you first.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T><A1/1>And what would that be?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Do you recall the explosion at the
Institute of Polydimensional
Research, 10 years ago?
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T><J54>What did you just say?!<K><Q></J>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I'll take that as a yes.<W> It is
imperative that I see any and all
case files on that incident.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T><A1/5>It sounds like you're on to
something here, Layton. What do
you know?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Nothing at the moment. But I have
a suspicion your current case is
somehow linked to this old one.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T>Hmm. I'd like to help, really I
would. But those files are sealed
and require top-level clearance.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T>Even a high-ranking officer like
myself would have trouble getting
his hands on those.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I see...
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I had hoped a man of your status
might have the necessary clout to
acquire those documents.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Unfortunately, it seems I may have
hoped for too much. I'm sorry to
have asked the impossible of you.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T><A1/1>Er...<W> Wait just a moment, Layton.
I...just might be able to get
you access to the case files.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Excellent. I would be extremely
grateful for that.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T>Just one thing, though. These
documents don't come for free.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T>I want to hear everything you know,
or suspect, about the prime
minister's whereabouts.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A3/2>Of course. Once I've seen the
documents and I'm sure my theory
is sound, every detail will be yours.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T><A4/2>Barton! Head down to the archives
and find those old files. Tell them
you're there on my orders.
!******************************!
<HDR:836F815B83678393>
<T><A3/0>Right away, sir!<A2/1>
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T><A1/1>Those files can't leave the
archives, but you can read
them down there.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T>Take the stairs down from the
lobby to the cellar.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Much appreciated, Inspector.
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T>The archives are in the cellar
under the lobby. You can peruse
the documents down there.
