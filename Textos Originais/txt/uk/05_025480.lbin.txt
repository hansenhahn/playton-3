<T><A2/1>Welcome to the archives.
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>I've gathered all the case files
pertaining to the explosion.
!******************************!
<T>Thank you, Barton. Your hard work
has saved us considerable time.
!******************************!
<T>Yuck! These papers are all mildewy
and covered in dust!
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>These files are off-limits to most
people. You're the first to touch
them in a long time.
!******************************!
<T>I see.
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>Hand some of those over and I'll
help you look through them. Where
should I start?
!******************************!
<T>I appreciate the offer, Luke, but I
should handle these myself.<A2/1>
They are top secret, after all.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Oh...<W> Of course. If you say so,
Professor.
!******************************!
<T>Just a bit longer, Luke. I'll be
finished soon.
!******************************!
