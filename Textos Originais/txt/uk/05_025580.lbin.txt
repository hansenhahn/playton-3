<T>Oh, hey, it's you again. Where are
you off to now, squirt?
!******************************!
<T>I...<W>can't say. It's a secret.
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>Oh.<W> Well, I was going to offer you
a puzzle, but it looks like you're
in a hurry, so...
!******************************!
<T>What's that? You've got a puzzle
that needs solving?
!******************************!
<T><A4/6>Hoo hoo! Now I've got your
attention, eh?
!******************************!
<T>I understand. Sometimes you need
to give your brain some space to
breathe.
!******************************!
<T>Back for more puzzle action,
kiddo?
!******************************!
<T>Splendiferous job!
!******************************!
<T>So... Are you sure you don't want
to tell me where you're headed?
