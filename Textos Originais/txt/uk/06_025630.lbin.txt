<T>Welcome back.<W> I take it you found
the information you were after?
!******************************!
<T>We did.<W> I hope Luke hasn't got
tired of waiting for us back in
the future.
!******************************!
<T>Yep, we mustn't keep the young
sir waiting.
!******************************!
<T>{''}Young sir{''}?
!******************************!
<T><A2/1><K>Hrm?<W></K> Oh! Heh heh heh! Did I just
call Luke {''}sir{''}?
!******************************!
<T>Sorry, it's an old habit from being
in service.
!******************************!
<T>My mind's just not as sharp as it
used to be, you know. I often get
a little muddled and-
!******************************!
<T>Hrm? Someone's at the door.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>You can't just barge onto private
property! It's illegal!<W> Not to
mention ungentlemanly!
!******************************!
<T>But I, madam, am no gentleman! I'm
an officer of the law, and I'm here
on an important investigation.
!******************************!
<T><A1/6>Wh-what's Inspector Chelmey doing
here?!
!******************************!
<T>You tailed us, didn't you,
Inspector?
!******************************!
<T>In which case, Spring is right. It is
very unbecoming of a gentleman.
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>Say what you will, Layton. The fact
remains that our prime minister is
missing!
!******************************!
<T>And if I have to step on a few toes
to find him, then that's what I'll do!
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>Inspector...
!******************************!
<T>And I'll keep doing it until you
lay your cards on the table, Layton.<W>
ALL of them.
!******************************!
<T><A3/3>I can't believe you, Professor!
!******************************!
<T>You too, Luke!
!******************************!
<T>F-Flora!
!******************************!
<T>You ran off and left me on my own
again! I'd even made you those
nice cucumber sandwiches!
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Flora, please. We just didn't want
to put you in danger, that's all.
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>You say that, but the real reason
you won't take me is because you
think I'll get in the way! Isn't it?
!******************************!
<T><A1/3>No! That's not it at all!
!******************************!
<T>Flora, you have to understand.
<W>You could be put in harm's way.
It's for your own safety that-
!******************************!
<T><A1/3>I don't know anyone else here.
What am I supposed to do when you
two run off?
!******************************!
<T>Just sit there like a lemon and
wait?!
!******************************!
<T><A4/4>Well, when you put it that way...
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Luke!
!******************************!
<T><A2/6>You know, Layton, I think the girl
has a point.
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>You may be leaving her behind out
of concern, but that doesn't help
anyone if it gets her all upset.
!******************************!
<T>Inspector? You too?
!******************************!
<T>Er, sorry to interrupt, but we've 
got to get going. We can't keep
Luke waiting any longer.
!******************************!
<T>I have to start her up now.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>But there are several people here
who have nothing to do with the
matter at hand.
!******************************!
<T>Well...<W> The more the merrier, that's
what they say, isn't it?
!******************************!
<T>That's ridiculous. I beg you to
reconsider.
!******************************!
<T>Sorry, Professor. We've got to go.<A3/0>
Hold on, everyone!<A1/1>
!******************************!
<T><A2/5>Hold on? What for?
!******************************!
