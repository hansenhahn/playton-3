<T>Okay! End of the line! Everyone out!
Heh heh!
!******************************!
<T>What in the world...?
!******************************!
<T>Urgh... My stomach's doing backflips
again.
!******************************!
<T>Hey, Layton! What just happened?
!******************************!
<T>Step outside and see for yourself,
Inspector. That should serve as
sufficient explanation.
!******************************!
<T><A2/6>What are you on about now?<W>
Hmph. Come on then, Barton.
Let's go outside.
!******************************!
<T>Just a moment, Inspector. I'm
feeling a little queasy.<W> Very
queasy, actually...
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Pull yourself together, Constable!
We're going outside.
!******************************!
<T><A1/4>Please don't jostle me. I'm feeling
a bit green...
!******************************!
<T>Are you okay, Flora?
!******************************!
<T>It was a rather bumpy ride.
!******************************!
<T>I'll say. Time travel really takes it
out of you.
!******************************!
<T>I'm just...<W>a little...<W>dizzy...
!******************************!
<T><A1/6>Oh no! Flora!
!******************************!
