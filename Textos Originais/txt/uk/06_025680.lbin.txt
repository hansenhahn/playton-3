<T><A5/0>Layton!<W> Wh-what's all this? What's
happened to London?
!******************************!
<T>We're still in London, Inspector.
We've just been transported 10
years into the future.
!******************************!
<T><A2/5>But that's impossible!<W> <A2/6>Isn't it?<W>
<A2/1>Or...is it possible, Layton?
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>One thing is for certain. We're no
longer in the London we know.
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Hmm. Well, there will be plenty of
time for debate once my work here
is done.
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>I seem to recall you saying
something about the prime minister
being trapped in the future, yes?
!******************************!
<T>Yes.<W> It's by no means certain, but
it remains a definite possibility.
!******************************!
<T>Well then, what are we standing
around here for?<A5/0> The hunt is on,
Barton!
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>We're off to find the prime minister!
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>You know, Inspector, we may have
better luck tracking him down if
we work together on this case...
!******************************!
<T>That's enough from you, Layton.
The fact remains that you're a
civilian. I'll handle this on my own!
!******************************!
<T>Scotland Yard's finest are on the
case now! Your help is no longer
necessary, Layton.
