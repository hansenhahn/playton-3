<T>Keh heh heh. Well well, look who's
back!
!******************************!
<T>Mr...Stachenscarfen?!
!******************************!
<T>The one and only!<W> And who's your
feathered friend there?
!******************************!
<T>Oh, you mean <N1>?
!******************************!
<T>Rrrrrawk! Nice to meetchoo,
meetchoo!
!******************************!
<T>Keh heh heh! Nice to meet you too,
birdie.
!******************************!
<T>Say, you seem like a dependable lot.
Can I ask you a favour?
!******************************!
<T>I've recently become rather fond
of mushrooms. Especially those
little red ones, they're dee-licious!
!******************************!
<T>That's where you come in. I'd like
you to seek out one of those fine 
fungi and bring it back to me!
!******************************!
<T>A small, red, delicious mushroom...
I haven't a clue where we could find
one of those.
!******************************!
<T>Awwwrk! <N1> knows!
<N1> get!
!******************************!
<T>Keh heh heh! Now, that's the kind
of can-do attitude I like, birdie.
But are you really up to the task?
!******************************!
<T><N1>'s no ordinary
parrot! This should be a
doddle for him.
!******************************!
<T><N1> can now take on
requests from people you meet
during your adventure!<Q><W30><J403></J>
!******************************!
<T>Help <N1> complete the
requests given in the Parrot
minigame, available in the trunk.
!******************************!
<T>The more requests you succeed in
completing, the more skilful
<N1> becomes.
!******************************!
<T>If you complete enough requests,
he'll start to help you find hidden
hint coins.
!******************************!
<T>See if you can help <N1>
complete every delivery
request you come across.
!******************************!
<T>Let's get this show on the road.
Open the Parrot minigame in the
trunk and select my request.
!******************************!
<T>Fetching my mushroom should be no
problem for your parrot if he's
half the bird you say he is. 
!******************************!
<T>Now hurry! I can't get enough of
those little red mushrooms - you
just have to bring me one, quick!
!******************************!
