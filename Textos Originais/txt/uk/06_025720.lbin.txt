<T>Hi there, folks.<W> You look absolutely
knackered. Have you been out
walking all day? 
!******************************!
<T>We have. I can't say too much, but
we've been on quite the journey.
!******************************!
<T>Oh, is that so?
!******************************!
<T>What you really need to perk you up
is a nice big meal, but we don't
serve hot food here, I'm afraid.
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>I suppose I could whip up one of
our special ham rolls, though. If you
ask nicely, that is!
!******************************!
<T>That sounds great!<W> But what makes
it so special?
!******************************!
<T>It's all about the order of the
ingredients. Plus it has an
extra-special secret ingredient.
!******************************!
<T>Now I just have to remember how
to make the thing. How does it go
again?
!******************************!
<T><A2/5>Snack time is going to have to wait
until I remember how to make this
roll.
!******************************!
<T>All right. I'm sure you'll help me
remember how to make that ham roll
this time.
!******************************!
<T>Thanks for the help! As your
reward, here's your ham roll!
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>CHOMP!<W> Oh wow, this is amazing!
!******************************!
<T>Who would've thought potato salad
in a sandwich could be so delicious?
!******************************!
<T>And the crusty roll's a perfect
match for the tomato and cheese!<W>
I love it!
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>Not a patch on my cucumber
sandwiches, though, eh?
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>Uurk!<W>
!******************************!
<T>Uh-oh. Did that last bite get caught
in your throat? You shouldn't eat
so quickly, you know!
!******************************!
<T>Hello there, weary travellers! Feel
free to stop by any time you want
to rest your feet.
!******************************!
