<T>Dean Delmona!
!******************************!
<T>Oho! Fancy seeing you here,
Hershel!<W> Have you been keeping well?
!******************************!
<T>Very well, thank you. You're looking
rather well yourself, if I may say
so. Spry, even!
!******************************!
<T><A2/4>Oh goodness no! This old man is
growing older by the day.
!******************************!
<T>My hair's gone completely white,
see?
!******************************!
<T>Ah, yes. I thought there was
something different about you.
!******************************!
<T>Some people say silver hair makes
a man look distinguished, but I
was partial to my crop of brown.
!******************************!
<T>Now listen, Hershel: London's full
of people quick to sully your name.
!******************************!
<T>Rest assured that I don't believe
a word of it.
!******************************!
<T>That was quite a shock, Professor.<W>
We saw the dean a few hours ago,
and now he's aged a full 10 years.
!******************************!
<T>Yes... Time certainly appears to
have left its mark on Dean
Delmona...
!******************************!
<T>Is something the matter,
Professor?
!******************************!
<T>Not at all. I just needed a moment
to think. Let's be on our way.
!******************************!
<T>I came here to meet an old friend of
mine, but the fellow hasn't turned
up yet.
