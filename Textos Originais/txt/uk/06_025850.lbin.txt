<T>Greetings, Shipley.
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>Ah, Professor. Good timing. I just
got a message for ya from Luke.
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>He wants ya to go to the
observatory in the park
that's north of here.
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>Make sure yer not followed.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>This park is just off the path that
connects Flatstone Street to
Midland Road, correct?
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>That's the one. Luke will be waiting
for ya there.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Why do we need to make sure we're
not followed?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>It sounds as though someone out
there may be monitoring our
movements.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Are you paying attention to this,
Flora? It's very important.
!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T>Of course I'm listening, Professor.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Moving around in a group of three
will make us more conspicuous.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I know you don't want to be left
alone, but I think it would be best
if you waited for us at the hotel.
!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T><A1/5>What?!
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>As soon as we've caught up with the
other Luke, we'll come and get you.
!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T>No! I'm coming with you.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Now, Flora...
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Oh, come on, Professor. Let her
come along. We'll do our best to be
stealthy on our way to the park!
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><K>Hmm...
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>It'll be fine. Besides, it might be
more dangerous to leave Flora all
by herself.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I suppose you may have a point
there, Luke.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Flora, you do realise that where
we're headed could be extremely
dangerous, don't you?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Are you really sure you want to
come with us?
!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T><A1/2>Of course I do! I'm not scared.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Well, that settles it. Let's get
moving.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Well Luke, it looks as though
we'll have to put our dinner plans
on hold again, I'm afraid.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>I understand, Professor. I'm pretty
hungry, but we shouldn't keep
Big Luke waiting.
!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T>Well then, what are we waiting for?
Let's go!
!******************************!
<HDR:837583628360>
<T>Luke's waiting for ya at the park
observatory.
!******************************!
