<T>Of course! I love books! I've read
the Sherlock Holmes stories at

<T>Books are tricky things. Some are
enlightenment made physical, while
others are just piles of paper.

<T>Only by reading a book can one
decide whether it is worthwhile
or worthless.

<T>No man is born enlightened.
Acknowledge that you are an empty
vessel that's yet to be filled.

emptiness is what you will, in time,
recognise to be life.
