<T>It's Myrtle, isn't it? How do you
do? We're here to deliver a
message-

[hdr:000a0000000253000000025a000000]
[inf:83778355815b]
<T><A4/3>Let me guess. It's from that useless
husband of mine.

[inf:83778355815b]
<T>That sluggard just strolls about
town all day while I work my
fingers to the bone in here.
!******************************!
[hdr:000a00000002f700000002fe000000]
[inf:838b815b834e]
<T>Professor, what's a sluggard?
!******************************!
[hdr:000a0000000200000000021f010000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T>I'll, er, explain later, Luke.
!******************************!
[hdr:000a00000002000000000241010000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T>Now where was I? Ah yes - Rudolph
wanted to let you know he'll be
eating out for lunch today.
!******************************!
[hdr:000a000000025300000002a2010000]
[inf:83778355815b]
<T><A5/3>Hmph! At Pepper's, no doubt!
It's infuriating!
!******************************!
[hdr:000a000000025300000002da010000]
[inf:83778355815b]
<T><A6/3>I'm the one who works, and 
yet I still manage to make lunch
for us every single day.
!******************************!
[hdr:000a00000002530000000239020000]
[inf:83778355815b]
<T>And he has the nerve to let it go
to waste?!
!******************************!
[hdr:000a00000002000000000269020000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T><A1/1>Now, madam-
!******************************!
[hdr:000a0000000253000000027e020000]
[inf:83778355815b]
<T><A5/3>And another thing, we don't have
enough disposable income to be
eating out all the time!
!******************************!
[hdr:000a000000025300000002e0020000]
[inf:83778355815b]
<T><A6/3>I don't care how much he likes
those noodle soups! His behaviour
is simply shameful!
!******************************!
[hdr:000a0000000200000000023e030000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T>Well, erm, we've delivered the
message, so we'd best be off.
!******************************!
[hdr:00140000000253000000027e030000]
[inf:83778355815b]
<T>I spend valuable time picking out and
preparing delicious, nutritious
recipes, and this is my thanks?
!******************************!
[hdr:0014000000025300000002e7030000]
[inf:83778355815b]
<T>I'm a working woman, you know!<W>
<A2/5>Huh? Where did everyone go?
!******************************!
[hdr:001e00000002f7000000022e040000]
[inf:838b815b834e]
<T>Phew! That was quite intense.
!******************************!
[hdr:001e000000024f0400000256040000]
[inf:8341838d837d]
<T><A1/3>It just goes to show that when
someone prepares you food, you
can't just run off on them!
!******************************!
[hdr:001e00000002b904000002c4040000]
[inf:96a29788838b815b834e]
<T>Hey, where's the professor?
!******************************!
[hdr:0028000000020000000002e3040000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T>Here I am. You three surprised me. I
had no idea you could run so quickly.
!******************************!
[hdr:002800000002b90400000231050000]
[inf:96a29788838b815b834e]
<T><A2/5>My apologies, Professor. It was
getting a bit heated in there.
!******************************!
[hdr:0028000000024f0400000279050000]
[inf:8341838d837d]
<T><A3/3>But I still think it's very rude to
stand someone up when they've
prepared food for you!
!******************************!
[hdr:0028000000020000000002db050000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T><A3/2>Oh, yes... Absolutely.
!******************************!
[hdr:002800000002b904000002fb050000]
[inf:96a29788838b815b834e]
<T><A2/2>Right, now that's over with,
Rudolph needs to keep his side
of the bargain.
!******************************!
[hdr:002800000002b90400000250060000]
[inf:96a29788838b815b834e]
<T>Let's pay him another visit.
!******************************!
[hdr:003200000002530000000270060000]
[inf:83778355815b]
<T>Apologies for the outburst. I'm
just a bit sensitive when it
comes to, erm, lunch.
