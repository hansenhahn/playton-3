<T>Ohhh... So bored. So very, very
bored.
!******************************!
<T>Same old story, eh?
!******************************!
<T>Can you blame me? Life's not
exactly a bed o' roses, and I
don't have anyone to talk to.
!******************************!
<T>At least I'm not sad, though. The
only thing worse than being bored
is being sad.
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>I suppose so.<W> You know, if you want
someone to talk to, I'd be happy
to listen.
!******************************!
<T>That's nice of you. I bet you'll
grow up to be a nice fella. Thanks
for the offer, little chappie.
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>I feel better already. How about I
share one of my puzzles with you by
way of thanks?
!******************************!
<T>Yes, please! I love a good puzzle.
!******************************!
<T>Okay. Now digging's my game, see.
It's what I do. I thought of this
one at work one day...
!******************************!
<T>Don't look so down, little chappie.
You can always come back and try
again.
!******************************!
<T>I appreciate how nice you've been
to me. Let me thank you with this
puzzle I thought up.
!******************************!
<T>You're a smart little chap, aren't
you? You come back and see me
again sometime, yeah?
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>I really wish I could get back home.
It'd be nice to see the family.
My family, that is. Not THE Family.
!******************************!
