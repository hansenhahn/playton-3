<T>Salutations, mein amigo. I'm afraid
I'm a little bit lost.
!******************************!
<T>Hello there, Pavel. Fancy meeting
you here.<W> Where are you trying to
get to this time?
!******************************!
<T>I read a magnifique article about
the underground caverns of der welt
and decided to come and see them.
!******************************!
<T>Ah yes... I've done some research
into these caverns myself.
!******************************!
<T>They're said to exist under many
of the world's great cities.

!******************************!
<T>Hai, exactamente. I was on my way
to discover the subterranean
ruins of Rome...when I got lost.
!******************************!
<T>Wait... You were on your way to
Rome and ended up here?
!******************************!
<T>Ja. The road of a traveller is long
and winding. Nevertheless, I'm sure
I'm heading the right way.
!******************************!
<T>Seeing as how we bumped into each
other like this, though, how about
a puzzle pour la route?
!******************************!
