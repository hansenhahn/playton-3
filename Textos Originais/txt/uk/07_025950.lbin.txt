<T><A4/0>Ugh, this post is the pits. I can't
wait to clock off so I can get my
laughin' gear round a hot meal.
!******************************!
<T><A4/0>Mmm. Sounds good bruv. What I
wouldn't give for a pipin'-hot pasty
with some mushroom gravy.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>But hey, keep it down. Bostro'll
tan our hides if he hears us
talkin' food on the job.
!******************************!
<T><A3/5>Tsk. It's like all he does is watch
us to see if we mess up. What a
rotter to have as a boss.
!******************************!
<T>All right <N1>,
do your thing!
!******************************!
<T><K><A2/5>...
!******************************!
<T><A1/3>Psst, <N1>!
You're on!
!******************************!
<T><A4/0>Get lost!<W> Get lost!
!******************************!
<T><A2/5>Did you hear that bruv?! It was
Bostro!
!******************************!
<T><A2/5>Yeah! He told me to get lost!
Or was he talkin' to you?
!******************************!
<T>I think he meant both of us!
!******************************!
<T>I think you're right!<W> <A3/5>Aye aye,
Bostro. You don't need to tell us
twice. We'll get lost immediately!
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>Nice work, <N1>!
!******************************!
<T><A3/0>Skwaaarka skwawk!
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>Excellent! I think we can finally get
into Chinatown now!
!******************************!
<T>And it's all thanks to our friend
<N1>!
!******************************!
<T>Get lost!<W> Get lost!
!******************************!
<T><A4/4>Um... You can stop saying that now,
<N1>.
