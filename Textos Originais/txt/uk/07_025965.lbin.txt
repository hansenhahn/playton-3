<T>What's this device that's stuck
to the door?
!******************************!
<T>Oh no...<W> That's a puzzle counter.
!******************************!
<T>Oh no?<W> Why {''}oh no{''}?
!******************************!
<T><A1/4>These things count how many
puzzles you've solved.
!******************************!
<T>The door will only open for people
who've solved the required number
of puzzles.
!******************************!
<T>Here, have a look at the display on
the front of the machine.
!******************************!
<T>It says...50.
!******************************!
<T><A3/5>You've got at least 50 puzzles
under your belt, I hope?
!******************************!
<T>I don't know, but I can't wait to 
try out the machine. The future's
just full of fancy gadgets!
!******************************!
<T>BZZEEP! Insufficient puzzles
solved. Access denied.
!******************************!
<T><A1/6>Oh no!
!******************************!
<T>I didn't anticipate this. I suppose
we'll just have to come back
after solving some more puzzles.
!******************************!
<T>The display on the puzzle counter
says 50.
!******************************!
<T>Step up and let the device take a
reading. We've hopefully solved
enough puzzles by now.
!******************************!
<T>BZZEEP! Insufficient puzzles

after solving a few more puzzles.
