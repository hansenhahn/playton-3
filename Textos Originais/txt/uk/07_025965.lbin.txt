<T><A1/4>These things count how many
puzzles you've solved.

<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>The door will only open for people
who've solved the required number
of puzzles.

<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>Here, have a look at the display on
the front of the machine.

<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>It says...50.

<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T><A3/5>You've got at least 50 puzzles
under your belt, I hope?

<T>I didn't anticipate this. I suppose
we'll just have to come back
after solving some more puzzles.

<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>The display on the puzzle counter
says 50.
