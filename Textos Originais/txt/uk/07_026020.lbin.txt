<T>Hello there. Do you live in
Chinatown? Could you tell us a
little about the area?
!******************************!
<T>Listen to yourself, young man.
<A2/1>Like all sentient beings, we exist
both everywhere and nowhere.
!******************************!
<T>Well that's very...nice.
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Now, if what you really wanted to
ask me was where my physical body
resides, I'll tell you.
!******************************!
<T>I do indeed {''}live{''} in Chinatown.
!******************************!
<T><A3/3>Here you can find exotic goods
and rare wonders from all over
the world.
!******************************!
<T>But these things don't interest me.
Material objects are mere flecks
of dust on the universe's canvas.
!******************************!
<T><A4/4>Ugh. Something tells me I picked the
wrong person to ask for
directions.
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>You've only just started making
your way in this world, young one.
!******************************!
<T>For you, many of life's greatest
puzzles remain unsolved.<W> This one,
for example.
!******************************!
<T>Learn, but do not lose your
individuality. You mustn't conform
to the values of the masses.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Erm... I'll try my best.
!******************************!
<T>I see you've returned, young one.
!******************************!
<T>Yes, that's it! Seek the answers to
your own questions! That is the
root of individuality.
!******************************!
<T>Only by doing this will you find the
true value to be had in the infinite
moment we call the present.
!******************************!
<T>Erm...<W> Thanks for the compliment,
but I have to go now. Bye!
!******************************!
