<T>Into your toys, are you, lad?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>I used to be! <A3/2>But I don't have much
time for toys now that I'm older.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/2>Ho ho! But what about that toy car
you're so fond of?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>I suppose you've got me there,
Professor. That car's just too
much fun to put down!

<HDR:835883658342815B8375>
<T>A toy car, you say? Let's have a
look...<W> <A3/1>Ah yes, this is one of my
creations.

<HDR:835883658342815B8375>
<T>Hyeh heh! Thank you kindly. Here,
since you're such a fan, I'll make
you a special offer.

<HDR:835883658342815B8375>
<T>If you can solve this puzzle of mine,
I'll give you a special track for
your toy car!

<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>A special track just for solving a
puzzle?<W2> <A3/2>This is my lucky day!
!******************************!
<HDR:835883658342815B8375>
<T>Are you really giving up, lad? But
you seemed so confident just a
moment ago.
!******************************!
<HDR:835883658342815B8375>
<T>I have a new track that'll knock
your socks off. But first, you'll
have to solve my puzzle.
