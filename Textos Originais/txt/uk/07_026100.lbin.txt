<T><A2/3>What is it? Hmm? What do you
want? Can't you see I'm in a
hurry here?
!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T>Oh Luke, I think you've upset him.
!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T>You can't just go running up to
strangers and expect them to
chat to you, you know.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>I can't help it, Flora. How else are
we supposed to find leads for our

!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>

<HDR:8368834E8367838A815B>
<T>I've got places to be and I could

<HDR:8368834E8367838A815B>
<T>Hmm? Like what?
!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T>With your trousers and shoes all
dripping wet. It must be awfully
uncomfortable.
!******************************!
<HDR:8368834E8367838A815B>
<T><A4/3>There will be time for drying off
later! I have to go now. Enjoy your
little row.

<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Drat. He's gone.
!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T>He might have stayed if you hadn't
got off on the wrong foot.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>You can hardly blame that on me...
