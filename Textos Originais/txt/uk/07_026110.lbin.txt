<T>Books are sustenance for the soul.
Have you discovered the value of
the written word, young one?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Of course! I love books! I've read
the Sherlock Holmes stories at
least a dozen times.
!******************************!
<HDR:837E815B83608346>
<T>Books are tricky things. Some are
enlightenment made physical, while
others are just piles of paper.
!******************************!
<HDR:837E815B83608346>
<T>Only by reading a book can one
decide whether it is worthwhile
or worthless.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>I never thought about it that way.
!******************************!
<HDR:837E815B83608346>
<T><A2/3>Yes... Within books sleep a thousand
puzzles.<W> Here's one more.

!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Huh?
!******************************!
<HDR:837E815B83608346>
<T>No man is born enlightened.
Acknowledge that you are an empty
vessel that's yet to be filled.
!******************************!
<HDR:837E815B83608346>
<T>And the substance that will fill that
emptiness is what you will, in time,
recognise to be life.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Empty vessel. Right.
!******************************!
<HDR:837E815B83608346>
<T>A spirit that rises to a challenge
in the wake of prior defeat is the
most precious of gems.
!******************************!
<HDR:837E815B83608346>
<T>Paper and ink are mere objects.
In time, they will rot and vanish.
!******************************!
<HDR:837E815B83608346>
<T>But the ideas and knowledge that
books contain are eternal.
!******************************!
<HDR:837E815B83608346>
<T>Unless they are trashy novels.
!******************************!
<HDR:837E815B83608346>
<T>Aspire to read as many books of
real value as possible, young one.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>What about Sherlock Holmes? Are
those books of value?
!******************************!
<HDR:837E815B83608346>
<T>Oh, absolutely. They are the filet
mignon of soul sustenance.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A3/2>That's all right then!
