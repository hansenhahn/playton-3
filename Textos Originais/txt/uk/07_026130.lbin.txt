<T>You were using that girl as a
d-<W30>d-<W30>decoy to lure me out of hiding!
I knew it!
!******************************!
<HDR:83778343835B838B>
<T><A4/5>I knew something was up when she
started chatting to me out of the
b-<W30>b-<W30>blue!
!******************************!
<HDR:83778343835B838B>
<T><A5/1>Why oh why did I stop to talk to
her?!
!******************************!
<HDR:83778343835B838B>
<T>Now you've got me right where
you want me. I'm getting out of
h-<W30>h-<W30>here!

<T>I haven't got a clue, Professor.

<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T>He was nice. Is he a friend of yours,
Luke?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A4/4>I wish I could say that, but I
can't even get him to stop
cowering in fear.
