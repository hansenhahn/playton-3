<T>What's up, fellas?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>We went to see the man in the
Towering Pagoda, but he was out.
Do you know where he might be?
!******************************!
<HDR:8366834283898393>
<T><A2/6>I've got a pretty good idea...
<A2/5>But I'm not telling. He's dangerous.
You don't wanna tangle with him.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Come now, surely there's no harm
in letting us know where he might
be?
!******************************!
<HDR:8366834283898393>
<T>You're wrong there, but...<A1/4>I s'pose
I can tell you what I've heard. It's
just a rumour, though.
!******************************!
<HDR:8366834283898393>
<T>You sure you wanna know this?
I'm telling you, this fella's bad
news.<W> Proper bad.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>We can handle it. What have you
heard?
!******************************!
<HDR:8366834283898393>
<T>People say he disguises himself and
goes walking around town.
!******************************!
<HDR:8366834283898393>
<T>He could be standing next to us now
and we wouldn't even know!
!******************************!
<HDR:8366834283898393>
<T>Scary stuff, eh?<W> Actually, I'm
getting spooked myself, so let's
end this little chat, okay?<W> Laters.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Why would the professor of the
future want to dress up and run
around town?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>You never do that, Professor.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Oh? How would you know, Luke?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/6>Huh?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/2>Ha ha. Just pulling your leg, my boy.
!******************************!
<HDR:8366834283898393>
<T>You be careful out there, all right?
!******************************!
