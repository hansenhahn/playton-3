<T>Welcome to Pepper's Noodle Palace!
!******************************!
<HDR:837C838B8365>
<T>What will it be, gents?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>We're not here to eat, I'm afraid.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>We just want to ask you a few
questions about the fellow who
runs the Towering Pagoda.
!******************************!
<HDR:837C838B8365>
<T><A1/3>You mean I really can't interest
you in a bite to eat? Well...<W> All
right. Now, what were you saying?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>We'd like to meet the man who runs
the Towering Pagoda, but he seems
to be out at the moment.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Has he come by your restaurant, by
any chance?
!******************************!
<HDR:837C838B8365>
<T><A1/4>I don't think so. I mean, I don't
even know what he looks like.
!******************************!
<HDR:837C838B8365>
<T>But his lackeys come by here to
slack off on a daily basis. Terrible
table manners they've got, too.
!******************************!
<HDR:837C838B8365>
<T><A3/1>Come to think of it, that probably
means the man you're looking for
never comes in here.
!******************************!
<HDR:837C838B8365>
<T>I mean, would you go skiving off in
a place where the boss could burst
in at any moment?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/2>You make a good point. That's very
astute of you.
!******************************!
<HDR:837C838B8365>
<T><A2/1>Flattery's nice, but if you really
want to say thanks, order some
food next time you come in, okay?
!******************************!
