<T>It's Myrtle, isn't it? How do you
do? We're here to deliver a
message-
!******************************!
<T><A4/3>Let me guess. It's from that useless
husband of mine.
!******************************!
<T>That sluggard just strolls about
town all day while I work my
fingers to the bone in here.
!******************************!
<T>Professor, what's a sluggard?
!******************************!
<T>I'll, er, explain later, Luke.
!******************************!
<T>Now where was I? Ah yes - Rudolph
wanted to let you know he'll be
eating out for lunch today.
!******************************!
<T><A5/3>Hmph! At Pepper's, no doubt!
It's infuriating!
!******************************!
<T><A6/3>I'm the one who works, and 
yet I still manage to make lunch
for us every single day.
!******************************!
<T>And he has the nerve to let it go
to waste?!
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Now, madam-
!******************************!
<T><A5/3>And another thing, we don't have
enough disposable income to be
eating out all the time!
!******************************!
<T><A6/3>I don't care how much he likes
those noodle soups! His behaviour
is simply shameful!
!******************************!
<T>Well, erm, we've delivered the
message, so we'd best be off.
!******************************!
<T>I spend valuable time picking out and
preparing delicious, nutritious
recipes, and this is my thanks?
!******************************!
<T>I'm a working woman, you know!<W>
<A2/5>Huh? Where did everyone go?
!******************************!
<T>Phew! That was quite intense.
!******************************!
<T><A1/3>It just goes to show that when
someone prepares you food, you
can't just run off on them!
!******************************!
<T>Hey, where's the professor?
!******************************!
<T>Here I am. You three surprised me. I
had no idea you could run so quickly.
!******************************!
<T><A2/5>My apologies, Professor. It was
getting a bit heated in there.
!******************************!
<T><A3/3>But I still think it's very rude to
stand someone up when they've
prepared food for you!
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Oh, yes... Absolutely.
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>Right, now that's over with,
Rudolph needs to keep his side
of the bargain.
!******************************!
<T>Let's pay him another visit.
!******************************!
<T>Apologies for the outburst. I'm
just a bit sensitive when it
comes to, erm, lunch.
!******************************!
