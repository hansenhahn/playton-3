<T>Hoo hoo! Did you deliver the
message to my sugar lump?

!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>We did, but I have to tell you, she
was absolutely seething by the time
we left.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B8368838B8374>
<T>Whatever for?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>She seemed rather upset at the 
thought that you might be dining
at Pepper's Noodle Palace...
!******************************!
<HDR:838B8368838B8374>
<T><A2/1>Hoo hoo hoo. Dear me, I fear there
may be a misunderstanding brewing
here.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Do go on.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B8368838B8374>
<T>My wife is a gem. I treat her like
a queen.<W> And queens shouldn't
have to prepare lunch!
!******************************!
<HDR:838B8368838B8374>
<T>She works so hard that I don't
want to add to her burden.<W> Plus,
who doesn't love noodle soup?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B8368838B8374>
<T><A1/1>Anyway, I'm boring you now.<W> Let me
give you that bit of information I
promised.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B8368838B8374>
<T>This is just a rumour, but I've
heard that the fellow you're after
is quite fond of Old Father Thames.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B8368838B8374>
<T>It's said he likes going for walks
to admire the river whenever he
has a spare moment.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Interesting. So there's a chance
we'll find our man down by the
river?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B8368838B8374>
<T>Hoo hoo! As I said, it's a rumour
and nothing more. But go and see,
there may be some truth in it.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>We shall do just that.<W> Thank you for
the tip.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B8368838B8374>
<T>Just a moment now! Hoo hoo! You
whippersnappers are always rushing,
aren't you? Here, take this.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A3/1>A flyer?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B8368838B8374>
<T>It's for a small restaurant by the
Thames.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>The Thames Arms?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B8368838B8374>
<T>A lovely little place. If you're in the
area and have the time, you really
should drop in.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A3/2>It sounds like the perfect place to
take a break. We'll be sure to visit
if time allows. 
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Good day, sir.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B8368838B8374>
<T>Oh! You lad, wait just a moment!
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Yes?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B8368838B8374>
<T>My wife, Myrtle. How, um, angry was
she, exactly?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Furious.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B8368838B8374>
<T>Oho. I see.<W> Thank you. That'll be all.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B8368838B8374>
<T>Oh dear...
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Is there a spot with a good view of
the river around here?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>There was that hill we walked over
on the way to Chinatown. You
could see the river from up there.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>The place that Luke's talking about
has some stairs that run down to
the riverside.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>It might be worth investigating.
!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T>Oh, goody! A walk by the river
sounds wonderful!
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/5>Flora, focus! This is serious
business. We're hot on the
trail of a criminal mastermind!
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T><A1/2>Come on, Luke, loosen up a little.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>We're making progress on the case,
and Flora's just finding her own
way to enjoy it.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A4/2>I suppose that's true.<W> Well, what
are we waiting for?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Nothing, Luke. Let's head for the
hill.
