<T>You there, with the shady
expression! Look me in the
eyes when I talk to you.
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Buzz off, will you? I'm reading here!
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>Listen, you hooligan, I'm acting
under the authority of Scotland
Yard!
!******************************!
<T>I demand that you comply with my
investigation!
!******************************!
<T>Scotland Yard? Pfft.<W> It's been
years since the police had any
power in this city.
!******************************!
<T><A5/0>No power, you say? You'd do well
to take a close look at the man
before you!
!******************************!
<T>The very sight of this face sends
thugs running for the hills!
!******************************!
<T><A5/0>Whoa there, settle down!<W>
<A4/1>S-somebody help me! This oddball's
getting too c-close for comfort!
!******************************!
<T>Inspector, please calm down!
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Hrm? Ah, Luke. Not now, lad. I'm
putting the screws on this dubious
character here.
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>Inspector, please. I can vouch for
this man. He's just an ordinary
citizen.
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Oh, so he's a friend of yours,
Layton? You should've said so
earlier.
!******************************!
<T>You're off the hook, newspaper
boy. But listen well, because I'll
only say this once.
!******************************!
<T>Th-thanks!<A3/1> I'm l-listening!
!******************************!
<T>The soul of Scotland Yard and what
it stands for is immortal! Even in a
corrupt pit of depravity like this!
!******************************!
<T>Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an
investigation to attend to.<W>
Good day, Layton.
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>Phew!<W> Thanks for saving me from
that loon. What was all that
gibberish about Scotland Yard?
!******************************!
<T>Oh, the inspector doesn't mean any
harm. He just tends to get a little
worked up.
