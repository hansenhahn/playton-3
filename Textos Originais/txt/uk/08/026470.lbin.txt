<T><A1/3>B-Belle?! What are you doing here?
!******************************!
[hdr:0014000000027b0000000284000000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T>Please forgive Luke. He is...easily
flustered.

<T>What a pleasant coincidence it is
to run into you here.

[hdr:001400000002000000000216010000]
[inf:8378838b]
<T>This is nothing short of fate!
Because, you see, Fluke and I are
destined for each other!
!******************************!
[hdr:0014000000027b0000000273010000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T>Well that's one way of looking at
it, I suppose.

<T>Fate? Destiny? Luke, just what
have you been telling this poor
girl?

<T><A1/5>Me?! Nothing! It's all one big
misunderstanding!
!******************************!
[hdr:001e00000002480000000230020000]
[inf:838b815b834e]
<T>B-Belle isn't... We aren't...
anything! We aren't anything!

[hdr:001e0000000200000000026f020000]
[inf:8378838b]
<T><A4/5>Oh Fluke. You're so cute when you
get all flustered like that. I could
just eat you up!

<T><A2/3>Shush now, my darling. There'll be
time for chit-chat later.
!******************************!
[hdr:001e0000000200000000023b030000]
[inf:8378838b]
<T>I came to let you know that I've
been seeing strange men running all
over town looking for you!
!******************************!
[hdr:001e0000000200000000029e030000]
[inf:8378838b]
<T>They keep going on and on about
{''}the boss{''}, {''}blue caps{''} and other
gibberish.

<T><A4/4>That sounds bad. Professor, do
you think the Family has finally
cottoned on to us?
!******************************!
[hdr:0028000000027b0000000256040000]
[inf:838c834383678393]
<T>I fear that might be the case.
If so, we have limited time.

<T>We must gain access to the Towering
Pagoda before the Family sends
more thugs into the area.

but you can stop worrying about
me now.

[hdr:00320000000248000000028d050000]
[inf:838b815b834e]
<T>And you can stop calling me weird
names!<W> All right, let's go.
