<T>Salutations and whatnot. What
brings upstandin' citizens like
yerselves back through here?
!******************************!
<T>We're tracking down the boss of
the Family. We got a hot tip that
he's down by the river!
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>Whoa now! Slow down!
!******************************!
<T>Keep sniffin' around for trouble
like that and something's bound to
start stinkin'. Take it from me.
!******************************!
<T>You certainly appear to be an
authority on such subjects.
!******************************!
<T>Don't you know it. And I can see
that you two aren't going to heed
my warning, either.
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>If yer dead set on goin' to the
riverside, ye should drop by the
restaurant down there.
!******************************!
<T>Their grub is top-notch. If yer
going to look for trouble, you might
as well do it on a full stomach.
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>There's a gem of a restaurant by
the riverside that ye should try.
The grub's out of this world.
!******************************!
