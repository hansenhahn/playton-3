<T>Hello Constable. Fancy seeing you
here!
!******************************!
<HDR:836F815B83678393>
<T><A3/0>Oh, hello.<A2/1> I've been all over
town gathering information, you
know.
!******************************!
<HDR:836F815B83678393>
<T>But all that walking has put me in
the mood for a snack.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A2/2>So that's why you were peeking
through the restaurant window!
!******************************!
<HDR:836F815B83678393>
<T>Yes. I must confess that a lovely
wobbly jelly caught my eye.
!******************************!
<HDR:836F815B83678393>
<T>Do a hungry man a favour and keep
my little break a secret from the
inspector, won't you?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/2>Ha ha! I wouldn't dream of reporting
you, my good man. But now that you
mention it, where is the inspector?
!******************************!
<HDR:836F815B83678393>
<T><A1/1>He's been conducting a series
of exhaustive interviews with
everyone he meets in town.
!******************************!
<HDR:836F815B83678393>
<T>Once he finds a useful source, he
really knows how to wring out
every last detail.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/1>I bet...
!******************************!
<HDR:836F815B83678393>
<T>I'd like to submit a request for a
snack break.
!******************************!
