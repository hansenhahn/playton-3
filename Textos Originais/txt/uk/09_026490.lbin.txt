<T>Unfortunately not, but I'm

!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T><A1/2>Yikes, jumpin' straight into the
lion's den, eh? You be careful down
there in Chinatown.
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>On the, um, off chance things get
hairy, come and talk to me. I'll
help ye out.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>The way you say that makes me
think there's more than an off
chance things'll get hairy...
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T><A2/1>Not at all, my small friend. But ya
know what they say: hope for the
best, prepare for the not best.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>The not best? Don't you mean the
worst?
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>Do I? I dunno.<W> Speakin' of
preparation, have you fellas ever
heard this one?
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>Leaving a job half done? I didn't
{''}prepare{''} for that possibility. Arf.
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>Here to try that puzzle again?<W>
Good! Here it is.
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>Now that's out the way, I s'pose

Pagoda, eh?
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>Watch yerselves out there, all
right?
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>

place. Keep an eye out for trouble,
won't ya?
