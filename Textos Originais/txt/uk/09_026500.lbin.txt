<T>Well hello again, whippersnappers!
Did you manage to find that nasty
man from the Towering Pagoda?
!******************************!
<T>No, it seems we just missed him
down by the river. But we believe
he's back at the pagoda now.
!******************************!
<T>Hoo hoo hoo! All this coming and
going must be taking it out of you!
!******************************!
<T>Good thing you're still young and
full of beans!
!******************************!
<T>And what about you, Rudolph? Have
you resolved your little problem?
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>Hrm? P-problem? I don't know what
you mean, lad...
!******************************!
<T><A1/3>Don't play innocent. Luke's talking
about your clandestine lunchtime
rendezvous with Pepper.
!******************************!
<T>Wh-what?<W> Oh no, no, no! My wife's
mistaken about all of that. Really,
it's nothing scandalous!
!******************************!
<T>Thanks for your concern, but it's
all just a big misunderstanding.
Please don't pay it any heed.
!******************************!
<T>I'm pleased to hear that there's no
reason to worry.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Now come along, everyone. We
mustn't waste any more time in
getting to the Towering Pagoda.
!******************************!
<T>Okay, Professor.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>I'd best head home myself...before
Myrtle explodes.
!******************************!
