gents. Thanks for stopping by
again.<W> Hungry already, are you?
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>I'm still quite full, actually.

<T><A3/2>We do know one police officer who'd
never turn down a bowl of noodles,
mind...

<T><A2/1>Hungry customers are my favourite
customers! I think I'll treat him to
a bowl on the house.

<T>It's not just the noodles that are
good here, you know - the noodle
puzzles aren't bad either. Here!

dig your chopsticks into this!

we're looking forward to coming
