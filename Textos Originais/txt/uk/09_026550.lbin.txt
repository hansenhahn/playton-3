<T>H-hey! What are you lot doing back
here?
!******************************!
<T>We're on our way to the Towering
Pagoda. Not that it's any of your
business.
!******************************!
<T><A2/5>N-not so fast!<W> You're the ones
who went on the rampage in the
casino, ain't you?
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>What if we are? What are you going
to do about it?
!******************************!
<T>I-I...<W> My bruv Chelton'd give you a
good hidin'...if he hadn't gone to
erm...spend a penny.
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>Looks like we're in luck then, eh?
We'll just be on our way now.
!******************************!
<T>If you run off, I'll make sure
Chelton squishes you like an ant
when he finds you!
!******************************!
<T>We'll bear that in mind.
!******************************!
<T>Wait! One more thing! Um...<W> Solve
this puzzle!
!******************************!
<T>You ain't no match for my puzzle,
so you ain't goin' nowhere!
!******************************!
<T>If you can't cough up an answer to
this puzzle, maybe I don't need
Chelton after all!
!******************************!
<T>Blast! You solved it.
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>We really don't have any more time
for this silliness. We'll be heading
to the pagoda now.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>F-fine! But remember, you got lucky!
!******************************!
<T>If my bruv was here, you'd be the
one gettin' bossed around!
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>Are you finished?
!******************************!
<T>Th-this ain't over! Mark my words!
You're gonna get what's comin' to
you!
!******************************!
