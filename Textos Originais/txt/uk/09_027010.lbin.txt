<T>I suppose it would be too much to
expect the door to be open...

<T>Let's see. The eyes of this dragon
seem to be the key that unlocks
this door.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A2/2>Sounds like a puzzle! Let me handle
it, Professor. I'll have the door
open before you know it!
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>I think I need another minute to
think about this...
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Would you like me to have a go
at it, Luke?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/5>That won't be necessary,
Professor. I'm sure I can solve
this one!
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I'm confident the door will open
just as soon as we solve this
puzzle.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>All set!
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A4/2>Smashing work, Luke.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>There's no time to celebrate. Let's
head inside.
