<T>What's this contraption,
Professor?
!******************************!
<T>It appears to be a peculiar set of
goggles.
!******************************!
<T>I think they're too big for me...
!******************************!
<T>Let's see...<W> Ah, this is some sort
of personal projection device.
!******************************!
<T>Personal what?
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>Think of it as a television for one,
Luke. Only the wearer can see the
image displayed inside.
!******************************!
<T>I'd wager that there's a puzzle in
these goggles that only the wearer
can see.
!******************************!
<T>Solving it is probably the only way
to get through this door.
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>Now that's high-tech!
!******************************!
<T>They should fit me comfortably.
Let's have a look.
!******************************!
<T>What do you see, Professor?
!******************************!
<T>Tee hee! Those glasses make you
look like a bug! A robot bug!
!******************************!
<T>I think something's coming into
focus here.
!******************************!
<T>I need to rest for a moment. These
glasses have a very tiring effect
on the eyes.
!******************************!
<T>All right. Time to give this one
another try.
!******************************!
<T>Phew! What a relief to take those
off. I was feeling all light-headed
and was having trouble focusing.
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>But it was all worth it! Thanks to
you, the door's unlocked and we're
free to move on!
!******************************!
<T>I don't believe I have any desire to
wear those strange goggles again.
!******************************!
