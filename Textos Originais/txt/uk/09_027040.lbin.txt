<T><A2/5>So, you're the one who's been
bullyin' my bruvver Barmey! You're
gonna pay for that!
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>Well well. Look who went crying to
the older boys.<W> What an impressive
act of bravery.
!******************************!
<T>Quiet, you! What was I supposed to
do back there? I was outnumbered!
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>There, there, I understand. You're
only small and you knew you had
no chance of stopping us.
!******************************!
<T>So, you're getting this big lump
here to do the dirty work for you.
!******************************!
<T><A3/5>Hmph! Sticks and stones, sunshine!
!******************************!
<T>Believe you me, if the boss allowed
violence in the pagoda, I'd have
pounded you already!
!******************************!
<T>Since I can't do that, I'll have to
sock it to you with this vicious
puzzle!
!******************************!
<T>Would you like me to deal with this
one, Big Luke?
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>Don't trouble yourself with this
piece of riff-raff, Professor. I
can handle anything he dishes out.
!******************************!
<T>This puzzle's no joke.
!******************************!
<T>Would you like me to step in for
you, Luke?
!******************************!
<T>I appreciate the offer, but I've
got this, Professor. I just need a
break to regain my focus.
!******************************!
<T>All right, let's try this again!
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>So much for that puzzle. What are
you going to do now?
!******************************!
<T>Hmph! You're lucky the boss
doesn't let me rough people up
in here.
!******************************!
<T>But you've gotta go outside at
some point, and when you do, watch
your back!
!******************************!
<T>Yeah! Too right!
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>All bark and no bite. Come on,
everyone. We've got places to be!
!******************************!
