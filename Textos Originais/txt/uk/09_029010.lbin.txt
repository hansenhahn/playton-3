<HDR:82C982B9838C834383678393>
<T>Fascinating! Do continue.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Luke, would you be so kind as to
solve a quick puzzle for me?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Uh...right now, Professor?<W> Aren't
we in the middle of something here?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Give it some more thought, Luke.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Let's try this once more.
!******************************!
<HDR:82C982B9838C834383678393>
<T>Yes, yes, the boy is quite bright.
We all know that. But what does
that have to do with anything?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I'm getting there.<W> But first, a
question. I have a pen in my pocket
that's either red or blue.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Could you tell me which colour it
is?

!******************************!
<HDR:82C982B9838C834383678393>
<T>What a terribly uncharacteristic
query for you to make. There's no
logic for me to work through.
!******************************!
<HDR:82C982B9838C834383678393>
<T>I'm not a mind-reader, and I refuse
to guess blindly. How can I solve
your puzzle without a single hint?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>So in other words, you have no
idea what colour pen I have in my
pocket?
!******************************!
<HDR:82C982B9838C834383678393>
<T>Of course not.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>That's funny.
!******************************!
<HDR:82C982B9838C834383678393>
<T>Oh?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A2/1>Luke, what would happen if you
removed the bottom row of blocks
from that pile I just showed you?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>The rest of the blocks would fall
down, I suppose.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>That's right. Those blocks in the
middle of the structure don't float
in mid-air.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Only by resting on the blocks
beneath can those blocks stay
elevated.
!******************************!
<HDR:82C982B9838C834383678393>
<T><K>...
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/1>If you were really my future self,
you would have experienced this
very moment before.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>There is simply no way you could
forget it.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Given your answer, I can only
assume that your memory of this
crucial event is missing.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>But remember those blocks. All
blocks are supported by other
blocks.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>When you remove one, everything
on top of it comes tumbling down.
<W>The same goes for memory.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>You can't simply be missing a
whole block of memory. It would
destroy your very persona.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/6>It all makes sense now!
!******************************!
<HDR:82C982B9838C834383678393>
<T>I see... So, what colour is the pen
in your pocket, then?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/2>My pockets are empty. There was
never a pen there to begin with.
!******************************!
<HDR:82C982B9838C834383678393>
<T><K>...
