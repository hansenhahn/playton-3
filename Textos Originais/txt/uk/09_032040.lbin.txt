<T>Aha! There's a trapdoor here!
!******************************!
<T>Then my hunch was right. It looks
as if we've found a way out of here.
!******************************!
<T><A2/3>Oof! They must have built this
stairwell for men less, er, buff and
muscular than me!
!******************************!
<T><A3/5>And there's more than one path!
Which way do we go, Layton?
!******************************!
<T>Look, there's a map here that
charts out the network of tunnels
below us.
!******************************!
<T>Let me see. <W>My, this is a bit of a
tangled mess, isn't it?
!******************************!
<T>Strange. I was sure I'd found a
way through. I'll just have to try
again.
!******************************!
<T>We need to plot our escape route
before heading down.
!******************************!
<T><A1/4>The passages below are too narrow
for all of us to move through at
the same time.
!******************************!
<T>If we want to get out of here
quickly, we'll need to split into
two groups.
!******************************!
<T>Hmm. I don't like it, but it seems
we've no choice. Now, who should I
take with me...?
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>You always get to be the gentleman.
This time, I want to escort the
young lady.
!******************************!
<T>Sorry, but I'd prefer you to come
with me, Don Paolo.
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>Very well then. Flora and I will go
together.
!******************************!
<T>Luke, you go with the professor
and help him keep an eye on Don
Paolo.
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>Trade with me, Little Luke! I want
to be in the professor's group.
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>We'll see each other soon enough,
Flora.<W> Go with Big Luke, and we'll
meet back at the hotel.
!******************************!
<T>All right, the groups are set.<W>
Let's get moving.
!******************************!
