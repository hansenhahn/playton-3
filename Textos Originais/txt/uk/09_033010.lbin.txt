<V0010><T><A4/1>Layton has been my arch-nemesis
ever since that fateful day!</V>
!******************************!
<V0020><T>I see...</V>
!******************************!
<V0030><T><A4/2>Yes, though it's worth mentioning
that I had no inkling of Paul's
crush until he told me himself.</V>
!******************************!
<V0040><T>He was in the year above me at
university.</V>
!******************************!
<T><V0041>Imagine my surprise when I learned
that Don Paolo was none other
than my old classmate Paul.</V>
!******************************!
<V0050><T><A4/4>I had no idea you'd been through
so much. Sorry for being so mean
to you, um, Paul.</V>
!******************************!
<V0060><T><A2/3>Ugh. Spare me your sappy sympathy.
<A5/2>And my name is Don Paolo. Address
me as such, boy!</V>
!******************************!
<V0070><T><A1/2>Anyway, you put on quite the
performance, er, Don Paolo.</V>
!******************************!
<V0080><T>With you distracting Dimitri, I
had just enough time to do some
sleuthing in the area.</V>
!******************************!
<V0090><T><A3/2>So, that's what you were doing while
we were climbing the pagoda! Did
you find anything?</V>
!******************************!
<V0100><T>Yes, but I need to confirm a few
facts before I can connect all the
dots.</V>
!******************************!
<V0110><T>Then it sounds like that should
be our next move. Where to,
Professor?</V>
!******************************!
<V0120><T><A1/2>Oh ho ho! I'll let you ponder that
for yourself.</V>
!******************************!
<V0130><T><A2/1>But first, we should head back to
the hotel. Flora and the other Luke
are waiting for us there.</V>
