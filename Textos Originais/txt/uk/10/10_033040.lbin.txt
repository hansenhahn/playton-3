<T>So, let me get this straight. Dimitri
is building a time machine to go
back to the past and save Claire?

<T><A2/1>Funny. We went through every floor
in the pagoda and I didn't see
anything like a time machine.

<T>Dimitri clearly had a destination
in mind when he escaped from the

while we were climbing the Towering
Pagoda with Don Paolo?

with Flora and Big Luke.
