<T>I don't want to waste too much
time in getting back to the hotel,
so let's take the train.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Sounds good to me.
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T><A6/2>Fine. Then this is where we part
ways. I've got other things to do.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/5>You sure you're not running off
to formulate some kind of evil plan?
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T>Now why would you ever accuse me
of that?! Truly, I'm wounded.
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T><A7/0>I'm just going to work on a pet
project of mine that I've been
meaning to finish.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Very well, Paul. Meet up with us
later when you're ready.<W> <A3/1>You can
find us-
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T><A4/1>Yeah, yeah, Layton. I'm no fool.<W>
I'll know where to find you.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>And now he's gone.<W> Are you sure
it's wise to leave him to his own
devices?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/2>I understand your concern, Luke,
but I think we can trust him now.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>I suppose so, Professor.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>He must have cared an awful lot
for Claire if losing her to you
turned him into {''}Don Paolo{''}.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>He certainly was quite besotted.<W>
But enough about that now. We
have work to do.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Let's get moving.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A4/1>All right, but I'm still none the wiser
as to our next step, <A4/4>especially now
we know Future Layton is a fake.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Well, in light of these new
developments, our first priority
is to rescue the prime minister.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Dimitri fled the Towering Pagoda
with Mr Hawks, so he must have
another hideout in the area.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A4/1>And we're going to find it!<W> Oh, but
first we need to go to the hotel.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A2/2>That's right. We need to meet
Flora and Big Luke at the hotel.
Hopefully they got back safely.
