<T>I'm obsessed with organisation and
scheduling. It's really useful, but
it can be stressful at times.
!******************************!
<T>Well, you can't organise everything.
Sometimes it's best to just take
things as they come.
!******************************!
<T>Next time you start fretting, I'd
recommend a five-minute break and
a cup of tea.
!******************************!
<T>That's not a bad idea. I'll pencil
a tea break into my daily study
hour.
