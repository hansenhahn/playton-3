<T>Oh, heading out again already?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>That's right.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/1>By the way, Becky, I was wondering
if there's somewhere nearby where
we can cross the river.
!******************************!
<HDR:83788362834C815B>
<T>There's the bridge,<A1/5> but it's quite
a long way out beyond Chinatown.
!******************************!
<HDR:837D815B834B838C83628367>
<T>Do excuse me, but I couldn't help
but hear that you're trying to
cross the river?
!******************************!
<HDR:83788362834C815B>
<T><A1/1>Granny! I didn't realise you
were awake.
!******************************!
<HDR:837D815B834B838C83628367>
<T>Becky, we've been over this! In
front of the guests, you're to 
refer to me as {''}the manager{''}!
!******************************!
<HDR:837D815B834B838C83628367>
<T>Now where were we?<W> Oh yes,
crossing the river.
!******************************!
<HDR:837D815B834B838C83628367>
<T>There used to be a tunnel that
would take you across.
!******************************!
<HDR:837D815B834B838C83628367>
<T>It went right under the river and
people could just walk through to
the other side.
!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T>Wow! A tunnel under the river
sounds amazing!
!******************************!
<HDR:837D815B834B838C83628367>
<T>Unfortunately, once the Family
gained control of the city, they
shut down the tunnel.
!******************************!
<HDR:837D815B834B838C83628367>
<T>Grafton might still know how to get
in, though...
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Grafton?
!******************************!
<HDR:837D815B834B838C83628367>
<T>Don't you know him? He's easy to
spot with those bushy eyebrows,
blue hat and scheming smile.
!******************************!
<HDR:837D815B834B838C83628367>
<T>Ah yes, we go back a long way...
!******************************!
<HDR:837D815B834B838C83628367>
<T>He spends most of his time down at
the black market these days.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A4/1>Ah, yes, I do believe we've met this
friend of yours before.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>You remember him, don't you, Luke?<W>
Luke?
!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T><A2/5><K>Hmm?<W></K> Where'd he go?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/1>He was here just a moment ago.
!******************************!
<HDR:83788362834C815B>
<T>Oh, are you looking for little Luke?<W>
I just saw him leaving.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>By himself? But where could he
possibly be going?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Please excuse me, madam, but I
have to go and find Luke. Thank
you for directing us to Grafton.
!******************************!
<HDR:837D815B834B838C83628367>
<T>Not at all. We at the Hotel Duke
are always delighted to assist our
guests.
