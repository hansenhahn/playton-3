<T>I'm sorry to disturb you, madam,
but you haven't seen the boy who's
travelling with me go by, have you?

<T>The country bumpkin in the blue
hat, is it? Yes, I saw him. Going up
Flatstone Street, he was.

<T>He didn't seem lost, see, so I just
let him be. Oh dear. I wish I'd
said something to him now.

<T><A1/2>Not to worry. I'm sure we'll find
him soon. Thank you for the
information.
