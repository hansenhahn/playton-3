<T><A5/1>Augh!<A6/0> What do you want?! Please
don't hurt meee!
!******************************!
<T>I simply wish to ask you a question,
sir. No need for theatrics.
!******************************!
<T><A2/5>Well...all right.
!******************************!
<T>The young fellow I've been
travelling with - have you seen
him anywhere around here?
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>You mean the one with the
blue hat and the p-<W30>p-<W30>piercing
stare?
!******************************!
<T>I'd hardly describe his stare as
{''}piercing{''}, but yes, I think we're
talking about the same boy.
!******************************!
<T>I haven't seen him around here.</T>
<TW>Is he lost?
!******************************!
<T>Either lost or wandering. I'm not
quite sure yet.
!******************************!
<T>If it will keep you from hunting me
down, I h-<W30>h-<W30>hope you find him soon.
!******************************!
<T>Er... Thank you.
