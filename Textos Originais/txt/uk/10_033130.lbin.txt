<T>Hello there, Max. Have you seen
Luke around here, by any chance?

<T><A3/0>BZZT!<W><A2/3> Nope. I don't think he's come
through this way.<W> <A1/1>Why? Is something
wrong?
!******************************!
<T>It's probably nothing serious. But
if you see him, do please let him
know I'm looking for him.
!******************************!
<T>DING DING DING!<W> <A1/2>Understood.
