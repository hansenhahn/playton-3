<T>What? What?! WHAT?!<W> Can't you see
I'm busy standin' around?
!******************************!
<T>Sorry to bother you, but have you
seen my young friend pass through
here? The one who loves puzzles?
!******************************!
<T>Hmm... Oh, the urchin? No, he
ain't come through here.
!******************************!
<T>I see. I thought he might have come
this way...
!******************************!
<T>Nope. But listen, when you find
him, tell him I'm workin' on a new
puzzle for him to solve, yeah?
!******************************!
<T>I certainly will.
