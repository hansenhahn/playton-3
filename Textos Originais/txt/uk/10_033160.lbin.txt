<T>Chomp chomp. Oh, hello Professor.
Can I - nom nom - help you?

<T>Barton, have you seen Luke
wandering about this area?
!******************************!
<HDR:836F815B8367839381699048816A>
<T>Shlurp! No. No, sir. Has the lad
got himself lost? 
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>It's beginning to look like it.
The thing is, I can't imagine where
he could be.

<HDR:836F815B8367839381699048816A>
<T>That - chomp chomp gulp - is a
little worrying, isn't it?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A2/1>Oh, and on the subject of missing
persons, you should know that the
inspector is looking for you.

<HDR:836F815B8367839381699048816A>
<T>Oh... Chomp chomp chomp. I see.

<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/2>Do check in with him when you have
a chance, won't you?
!******************************!
<HDR:836F815B8367839381699048816A>
<T>Yes, sir. I'll be sure to do so -
as soon as I finish this cake.
