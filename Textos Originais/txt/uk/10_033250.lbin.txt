<T>Hello Grafton.
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>Oho,<A2/1> that's the first time
someone's called me by me real name
in ages. Where'd you hear it?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>The proprietress of the hotel
informed us of your name.
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>Ah, dear old Maggie. She can be
quite fearsome, but underneath it
all, she's a good egg.
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T><A2/2>Anyway, what can I do for ya?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>We're trying to find a way across
the river. We were told you might
be able to help us.
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>Have ya tried jumpin'?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I must admit that's an option we've
never considered...
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T><A1/1>Heh, I'm just pullin' yer leg.
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>Well, there's a couple of boats
that leave from outside the
Thames Arms...
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>Those are just for those Family
thugs to use, mind.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I was told you knew of another way
across.
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>Ah, so Maggie laid it all out for
ya, did she?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>More or less.
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>Hmph. All right then. But things
are pretty rough across the river.
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>If yer set on headin' there, I need
to at least make sure ye've got
the brains to get across.
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>If ya can't even solve that little
puzzle, ye'll never make it across
the river!
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>I see ye've got the guts to give
me puzzle another try. But have
ya got the brains to solve it?
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>Hmph. Right, I see ye've got enough
brains to look after yerself out
there, so listen up.
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>Down by the riverside, there's a
door that leads to a tunnel under
the river.
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>That door's locked tighter than
a bank safe. But here's the thing.
There's a way to open it.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Go on.
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T><A2/1>Course, it's not a button or
anythin' that straightforward.
It's a fancy coded lock.
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>But since ya just solved me puzzle,
I reckon ya might have what it
takes to break the code.
!******************************!
<HDR:835A834B815B838B>
<T>I don't think anyone's used the
tunnel for yonks, but I'm sure ye'll
be able to break into it.
!******************************!
