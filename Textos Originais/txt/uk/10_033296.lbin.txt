<T>Hmph.<W> Well, look who we have here...
!******************************!
<T>You!
!******************************!
<T>I thought this place was unguarded!
!******************************!
<T><A2/5>You've got it all wrong, boy. I'm not
on guard.<W> <A2/6>I'm just having a break.
It's nice and quiet down here.
!******************************!
<T>But now that I've seen you, I can't
very well let you just waltz on past,
can I?
!******************************!
<T>Listen, we really need to pass
through. Can't you just look the
other way?
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Hmph.<W> Headed for the research
facility, are you?
!******************************!
<T>Okay, whatever. I'm not exactly on
the clock here, after all.
!******************************!
<T>But that doesn't mean I don't have
standards, and if you can't
measure up, you're out of luck.
!******************************!
<T>Standards? What kind of
standards?
!******************************!
<T>Puzzle standards, obviously.
It doesn't look to me as if you've
solved very many.
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>Come back when you've got at least
80 puzzles under your belt and I'll
consider letting you through.
!******************************!
<T>Hmph. <W>You need to have solved at
least 80 puzzles if you want to
pass. No way around it.
!******************************!
