<T>Hello there.
!******************************!
<T>Augh!<W> Not you again!
!******************************!
<T><A5/1>Stay away, you m-<W30>m-<W30>monster!
!******************************!
<T>You've got it all wrong. He's an
archaeology professor, and I'm his
apprentice. That's all.
!******************************!
<T>You can't fool me with those lies.
You're the b-<W30>b-<W>boss of the Family!
!******************************!
<T>You're quite mistaken, my good
man.<W> The boss of the Family has
modelled his appearance on mine.
!******************************!
<T><A2/5>The boss of the Family decided
to model himself on you?
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Precisely.
!******************************!
<T>If the b-<W30>b-<W30>baddest b-<W30>b-<W30>baddie
around looks up to you, what does
that say about you?
!******************************!
<T><A4/5>Somebody help!<A6/0> Heeeeeelp!
!******************************!
<T>There's just no reasoning with
that fellow.
!******************************!
<T>I'm starting to think he actually
enjoys being in a state of constant
terror.
!******************************!
<T><K>Hmm?<W></K> What are you still doing
here? I thought you'd run away.
!******************************!
<T>What's it to you?<W> I can come and
go as I please, shorty.
!******************************!
<T>What's all this now?
!******************************!
<T><A5/1>Augh!<W> I, d-<W30>d-<W30>didn't realise...<W> I mean,
I didn't think... I-<W> Forgive meeee!
!******************************!
<T>Strangely enough, I'm starting to
get used to people fleeing from me
in a state of panic.
!******************************!
