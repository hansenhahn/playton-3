<T>Hello there! How's that lovely
parrot of yours, eh? What was his
name again? <N1>?

<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>He's doing very well, thank you.

<T><A2/4>Good, good.<W> Um, I hate to have
to ask, but have you seen my
good-for-nothing husband around?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I assume you're referring to
Rudolph?
!******************************!
<HDR:83778355815B>
<T>That's the one, yes.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>We saw him just now, actually.
Outside the shop.
!******************************!
<HDR:83778355815B>
<T><A4/4>Just out for a nice little stroll, eh?
As if he hadn't a care in the world.
Is that what you're saying?!
!******************************!
<HDR:83778355815B>
<T>Oooh, when I get my hands on that
man...
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Ack! Maybe I should've kept my
mouth shut...
