<T>Hey look, you two. There's a
message scrawled here.
!******************************!
<T>Oh? Where?
!******************************!
<T>Right there, on that little scrap of
paper stuck on the wall. See it?
!******************************!
<T>Hmm, this is a tough one.
!******************************!
<T>Let me have another look at this.
!******************************!
<T>Ha! I did it! Who knows what would
have happened to us if I hadn't
solved that puzzle?!
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>Your help is greatly appreciated,
Flora. I do wonder who could have
left this message here, though.
