<T>This ladder's sure to take us down
into the research facility.

<T><A1/2>Ah yes, Captain Obvious to the
rescue once again.<W> Stand aside.
I'll lead the way.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A4/2>No way. I'm the youngest and the
nimblest. I should go first.
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T><A1/1>Being nimble doesn't make you
first - it makes you a monkey!<W>
Now stand aside!
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/5>Really, what kind of behaviour is
that for an adult?
!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T><A1/4>Oh, Don Paolo, I'm so disappointed
in you!
!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T>You were so polite and reasonable
when you were disguised as the
professor!
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T><A5/5>Of course I was. When I play a
part, I mimic every nuance of
the character!
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T>Right down to that hypocrite
Layton's phoney gentleman act.
!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T><A3/3>That's a terrible thing to say.
He's not acting like a gentleman.
He IS a gentleman!
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T>Whatever.<W> Look, let's settle this
debate with a puzzle. If the brat
solves it, he can go first.
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T>This puzzle's too much for you, eh?
Well, you are only Layton's
apprentice. It makes sense.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/3>There's no way I'm going to admit
defeat to that middling puzzle!
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Let me try again!
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T>Hmph. Perhaps your head's not as
empty as it looks. <A2/3>Well, a deal's
a deal. You can go down first.
