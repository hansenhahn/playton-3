<T><A1/1>Eh? Whit d'ye mean, {''}the real
Professor Layton{''}?
!******************************!
<T>Erm...<W> Look, I'll explain it all later,
we don't really have time to go into
it here.
!******************************!
<T>All you need to know for now is that
these people have come to help us
get out of here for good.
!******************************!
<T>You DO want to go back to our own
time, don't you?
!******************************!
<T>Oor own time?!<W> Aye, Ah'd do
anything tae get back there.<W>
Whit can Ah do for ye, Professor?
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>I have to find Dimitri, the man who's
been using my name.
!******************************!
<T>I hear he could be in the central
research room. Do you know where
that is?
!******************************!
<T>Aye, yer close! It's just a wee bit
doon the corridor.
!******************************!
<T>Wow, Ah still cannae believe yer the
real deal! That's a right turn up for
the books.
!******************************!
<T>As I recall, you were rather
surprised to see me the last
time we met as well.
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>Eh, well aye. Ah'm awful sorry, but
Ah wasnae tae know who Ah was
talking tae.
!******************************!

through here, gabbing something
aboot intruders.

!******************************!
<T><A1/6>What?! <A1/1>But how did he pick up on us
so quickly?
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>Bah, I should have known. We
probably tripped an infrared
sensor. Basic secret base stuff.
!******************************!
<T>No sense in standing around,
Layton. Let's go!
!******************************!
<T><A1/3>Professor, Ah need tae get back to
ma own time. Don't go letting me
