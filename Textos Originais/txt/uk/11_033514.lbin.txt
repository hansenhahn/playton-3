<T>You're Claire's...younger sister?
!******************************!
<T><A3/5>You look exactly like her! It's
uncanny...
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>We've crossed paths several times,
haven't we?
!******************************!
<T>And yet it's strange. Claire never
mentioned having a sister...
!******************************!
<T>It is my greatest regret that we
spent the last years of her life
estranged from each other.
!******************************!
<T>Forgive me for not getting in touch
with you earlier, Professor.
!******************************!
<T>I wanted to, but I was afraid it
might attract unwanted attention
from the Family.
!******************************!
<T><A3/5>For your own safety, I decided it
was best to avoid contact with you.
!******************************!
<T>I see.
!******************************!
<T><A5/5>You must have cared dearly for
your sister to come to a place
like this in search of the truth.
!******************************!
<T>Well, if I'm honest, I haven't been
running my own investigation so
much as tailing yours, Professor.
!******************************!
<T>But why?
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>Your reputation. Don't they say
the great Professor Layton
can solve any puzzle?
!******************************!
<T>I thought that if anyone could get
to the bottom of what happened
that day, it would be you.
!******************************!
<T>Celeste...<W> On the day of the
explosion, I-</430>
!******************************!
<T><A2/6>Oh no! The Family will be here any
second! We've got to run!
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>Ah, now's my time to shine! No one
makes a grand escape like
Don Paolo!
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>We can't move quickly in a big
group like this. We need to split up.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>I couldn't agree more. My dear
Celeste, please allow me to
personally escort you to safety.
!******************************!
<T>Layton, you take the kids!
!******************************!
<T>Celeste, wait! There's still so much
we need to discuss!
!******************************!
<T>Aha! Found you!
!******************************!
<T>Professor, this city hides a secret
so large it defies the imagination.
!******************************!
