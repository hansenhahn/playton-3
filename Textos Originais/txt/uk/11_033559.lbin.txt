<T>I...<W>am lost.
!******************************!
<T><A2/5>EEEK!
!******************************!
<T>Flora, are you okay?
!******************************!
<T>Scusa, comrades. It wasn't my
intention to scare the young
fr{:a}ulein.
!******************************!
<T><A1/6>Pavel!<W> <A1/1>What are you doing down
here?
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>I was exploring the area and
somehow ended up here. Perdido.
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>Doing some of the cavern
exploration you were talking
about before, I take it?
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Da. Earlier in my quest to find
the great tunnels, I mistakenly
wandered onto some train tracks.
!******************************!
<T>That little viaje put me in great
peril, but danger is part and parcel
of exploring el mundo, non?
!******************************!
<T>I suppose you could say that.
!******************************!
<T>Naturalmente, most of my travel
woes could've been avoided if my
compass hadn't been broken.
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>Though I think this map might be
able to show me which way to go.
A bit of help, bitte?
!******************************!
