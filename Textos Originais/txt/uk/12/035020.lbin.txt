<T>Find all the bombs.

The numbers above and to the left of the
map indicate the number of bombs in each
column and row. Red dots indicate people
and squares indicate tables. There are no
bombs in these squares.

Derive the location of all bombs using the
information provided, and mark them on
your map.
