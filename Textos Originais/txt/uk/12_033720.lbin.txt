<T><A2/2>I'm so glad we're finally able to
meet again.
!******************************!
<T>Where did you run off to?
!******************************!
<T>I was doing a little investigating
of my own, shadowing a suspicious
woman I'd seen around town.
!******************************!
<T>I saw her tailing you, Professor,
and decided someone had to find
out who she was.
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>Oh! You must be talking about
Celeste!
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>And? Where did you last see her?
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>I lost her for a while, but I just
saw her again, walking into this
restaurant.
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>Seconds later, I saw a friend of
ours go in as well.
!******************************!
<T>Oh, let me guess. Don Paolo!
!******************************!
<T><A1/4>I'm beginning to wonder whether I
even need to explain. You seem to
know it all already!
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>Well, we've been hard at work
investigating too!
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>Of course. I never expected you to
just wait idly for me to return.<W>
So, now what?
!******************************!
<T>All the players in our mystery are
here. I think it's time to reconvene
with Celeste.
!******************************!
<T>Players in our mystery?<W> What does
that mean...?
!******************************!
