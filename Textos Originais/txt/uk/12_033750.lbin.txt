<T><A2/2>Professor Layton! It's such a relief
to see you made it out all right.
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Why, I could hardly let myself get
caught before hearing about that
secret you mentioned, could I?
!******************************!
<T>Something tells me you've already
worked most of it out for yourself.
Am I right?
!******************************!
<T>Huh?!<W> Professor, is that true?
!******************************!
<T>If you know something, Layton, spit
it out!
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>All concerned parties seem to be in
attendance, so I'll try to explain
things as best I can.
