<V0010><T><A4/2>You mean to say we're underground
right now?</V>
!******************************!
<V0020><T><A2/1>Precisely. You may have heard of
subterranean caverns, as some of
them house ancient ruins.</V>
!******************************!
<V0030><T>Some experts theorise that these
caverns pepper the entire earth.</V>
!******************************!
<V0040><T><A1/1>What I've seen here leads me to
conclude that Dimitri used one such
cavern to build this false London.</V>
!******************************!
<V0050><T>It's as if we're standing in the
largest film set ever created.</V>
!******************************!
<V0060><T><A1/1>What?! I don't believe it!</V>
!******************************!
<V0070><T><A2/1>So Dimitri is behind all this then?
But why?</V>
!******************************!
<V0080><T><A4/3>That question stumped me as well.</V>
!******************************!
<V0090><T>Why would he go to such pains to
make us believe we're in the
future?</V>
!******************************!
<V0100><T>It doesn't make sense.<W> Unless
convincing people of this is the key
to achieving his ultimate goal.</V>
!******************************!
<V0110><T><A4/1>What kind of goal requires a set-up
like that?</V>
!******************************!
<V0120><T><A4/1>It's simple.</V>
!******************************!
<V0130><T>It seems that Dimitri never gave up
his original dream of building a time
machine.</V>
!******************************!
<V0140><T><A1/1>But though he poured all his energy
into achieving this feat, the task
was too large for one man.</V>
!******************************!
<V0150><T>He needed other scientists to
support his project, so he turned
to the greatest minds in London.</V>
!******************************!
<V0160><T>But to keep the scientists working
for him, they needed to believe
that they were in the future.</V>
!******************************!
<V0170><T><A1/6>Why?</V>
!******************************!
<V0180><T><A2/1>Think about it, Luke. Dimitri couldn't
imprison the scientists. Not in the
conventional sense.</V>
!******************************!
<T><V0181>After all, who knows what kind of
work they would produce under those
circumstances?</V>
!******************************!
<V0190><T>No, Dimitri needed a different
approach to compel the scientists
to complete his research.</V>
!******************************!
<V0200><T><A1/1>The scientists had to want the time
machine to work as much as
Dimitri did.</V>
!******************************!
<V0210><T>So he told them that they had been
shot forward 10 years in time,
stranded a decade from home.</V>
!******************************!
<V0220><T>Dimitri misled the scientists, telling
them that the time machine was an
unfinished project.</V>
!******************************!
<V0230><T>They thought they were stranded,
and that the machine was their
only hope of returning home.</V>
!******************************!
<V0240><T>Ah. So that's why they were so
willing to follow orders.</V>
!******************************!
<V0250><T><A3/1>That's all I've been able to work
out.<W> Perhaps our friend here can fill
us in on the rest.</V>
!******************************!
<V0260><T>Heh. I see you've caught on.
Excellent work as always, Hershel. </V>
!******************************!
<V0270><T>The Family uses this establishment
as a hideout.</V>
!******************************!
<T><V0271>Therefore, it seemed a bit odd that
the bartender didn't so much as
raise an eyebrow when we walked in.</V>
!******************************!
<V0280><T>I have to give credit where it's due.
I never imagined you'd work out so
much of the plan yourself.</V>
!******************************!
<V0290><T><A2/1>I suppose I have no choice but
to shut you up for good.</V>

!******************************!
