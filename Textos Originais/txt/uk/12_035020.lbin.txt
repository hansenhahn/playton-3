<T><A>Dimitri Allen! You've been watching
us the whole time?
!******************************!
<T>I wish to issue a challenge to the
professor. Bumbling lawmen have
no part in this conversation.
!******************************!
<T>B-bumbling!<W> I'll give you bumbling!
!******************************!
<T>It would be wise for you all to stay
exactly where you are.
!******************************!
<T>This restaurant is rigged with
enough explosives to level the
place... And they're ticking.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Are you out of your mind?! We'll all
die. Even you!
!******************************!
<T><A3/5>Me? Hah! No, I'm going to stroll
out of this place.
!******************************!
<T>You see, I know exactly how long
we've got left, and I know the way
out.
!******************************!
<T>Oh, and if you're thinking of
running away, make sure you don't
tread on a bomb. 
!******************************!
<T>One false step and...BOOM!
!******************************!
<T><A1/6>This place is a minefield!
!******************************!
<T><A2/6>That's right.<W> Now, I'm going to
watch you squirm a bit more...
!******************************!
<T><A3/5>And then leave you to your fate.
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>Well then, it would seem that you've
bested me, Dimitri.<W> There's nothing
I can do...
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Not exactly, Professor.
!******************************!
<T>Have a look at this piece of paper.
It tells you all you need to know
about the bombs in this room.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Fair enough. Let's see what we
have here.
!******************************!
<T><S671>Oho, well done, Professor. I
shouldn't have made it so easy
for you.
!******************************!
<T>You've found all the bombs. I
suppose you're going to avoid
getting blown up after all.
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>I'd say the same, unless, of course,
there was something you weren't
telling me.
!******************************!
<T>What?
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Luke, this paper isn't just telling
us where the bombs are. It's telling
us how much time we've got left...
!******************************!
<T>Hmm?<W> <A1/6>Oh!
!******************************!
<T>00! <W>Zero, Professor! It's all over!
The bombs are going to blow!
!******************************!
<T><K>...
!******************************!
<T>Not so fast, Luke...
!******************************!
<T><A4/4>Nooooo!
!******************************!
<T><A4/5>Wait, Luke. Listen.
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>This isn't 00. 
!******************************!
<T>This is the symbol for infinity. The
bombs are never going to go off...
because there are no bombs.
!******************************!
<T><A1/6>What?
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>That's it, Dimitri, isn't it?<W>
It's true you've done some evil
things, but you're not a killer.
!******************************!
<T>You just wanted to keep us busy so
you could make your escape.
!******************************!
<T>Before you take what might be your
last step, I'd check my numbers
again, Hershel.
!******************************!
<T>Find all the bombs.

The numbers above and to the left of the
map indicate the number of bombs in each
column and row. Red dots indicate people
and squares indicate tables. There are no
bombs in these squares.

Derive the location of all bombs using the
information provided, and mark them on
your map.
