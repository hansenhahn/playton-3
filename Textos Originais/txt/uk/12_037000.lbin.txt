<V0010><T>Because of Bill's greed, Claire was
lost to me forever.</V>
!******************************!
<V0020><T>Life is full of cruel twists.</V>
!******************************!
<V0030><T>In the blink of an eye, I lost my
life's work and the love of my life.</V>
!******************************!
<T><V0031>To say I was a broken man would be
an understatement.</V>
!******************************!
<V0040><T><A4/3>Bill, on the other hand, made a full
recovery from his injuries.</V>
!******************************!
<T><V0041>He also completed the deal with the
corporation, pocketing more money
than most people see in a lifetime.</V>
!******************************!
<V0050><T>He used his new-found fortune to
climb the political ladder to the
very top.</V>
!******************************!
<V0060><T><A1/1>He killed Claire and was rewarded
with the most powerful seat in
government.</V>

<T><V0061>If that's not a cruel joke, I don't
know what it is.</V>

<V0070><T>I can't pretend I wasn't bitter,
and it was this bitterness that
sent me back to my research.</V>
!******************************!
<T><V0071>I thought that if I could travel
to the past, I could rob Bill of
all that he had won.</V>
!******************************!
<V0080><T>Though of course, there was
another reason why I wanted to
go back in time.</V>
!******************************!
<T><V0081>To save Claire from her fate.<W>
Surely you understand, Hershel?</V>

<V0090><T><K>...<W><W></K></T><TW><A1/1>Claire is no longer with us.
There's nothing anyone can do to
turn back time.</V>

just one more question for you.</V>

<V0120><T><A4/3>What is it?</V>
