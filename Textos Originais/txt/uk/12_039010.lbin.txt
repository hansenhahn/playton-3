<V0010><T>Clive, you lived next door to the
lab that exploded 10 years ago.
You were just a child then.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0020><T>That blast demolished half of the
building you lived in.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0030><T>Reports indicate that 10 people
were killed in the explosion, two of
whom were your parents.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0040><T>It must have been a terrible shock.<W>
In the span of a few seconds, you
lost your family and your home.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0050><T>When the initial shock wore off, it
was replaced with anger.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><V0051>You became obsessed with exacting
revenge on those who had wronged
you.</V>

!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0070><T><A3/1>You were lucky enough to be adopted
by a kindly woman in her golden
years, Constance Dove.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0080><T>Miss Dove's extreme kindness was
matched in scale only by the
enormous fortune she possessed.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0090><T><A1/1>You two lived quite happily as a
family for a time.<W> Sadly, it wasn't
to last.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0100><T>Miss Dove departed from this world
five short years later, leaving
her fortune to you.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0110><T>Before long, you graduated from
secondary school and took a part-
time job at a prominent newspaper.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0120><T>Considering your sizeable
inheritance, I don't think you
took the job for pocket money.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><V0121>You were searching for something.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0130><T>Using the newspaper's resources,
you finally hunted down the men
responsible for your misery.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0140><T>You knew that both Bill Hawks and
Dimitri Allen were responsible for
the explosion.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0150><T>Armed with this information, you
concocted a plan to avenge your
parents.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0160><T><A2/1>First, you befriended Dimitri and
convinced him to resume his
research on the time machine.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0170><T>Then you used your inheritance to
set up this elaborate facsimile
of London.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0180><T>With your stage in place, you used
your contacts in the press to find
the best scientists in the country.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0190><T>After all, you would need quite a
bit of help to complete this time
machine.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0200><T>You then proceeded to lure these
brilliant men into your trap.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0210><T>However, unbeknownst to Dimitri,
most of your staff were not
working on the time machine.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:83668342837E8367838A815B>
<V0220><T>Wh-what?</V>

<V0230><T><K>...</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0240><T>Clive had secretly reassigned
many of the scientists to a
different project.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0250><T>You might think of it as his pet
project.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<V0260><T>We don't have all day, Layton!
What was the second project?</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0270><T>A weapon designed to cause
destruction on an unimaginable
scale.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:83668342837E8367838A815B>
<V0280><T>A weapon?! Is this true, Clive?</V>
