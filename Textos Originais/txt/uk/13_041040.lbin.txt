<T>So this is the weapon that Clive
was building...
!******************************!
<T>Did you know about this before?
!******************************!
<T>No! <A4/4>I suspected someone was
developing weapons behind
Dimitri's back...
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>But I never imagined that the
product of all that research
would be this atrocity!
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>In any case, it's dangerous here.
You need to leave at the double!
!******************************!
<T>But what about you?
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>I'm going to get Flora.
!******************************!
<T>Are you mad? Look at that thing!
You'll be killed!
!******************************!
<T>But I suppose I can't stop you,
can I?
!******************************!
<T>Flora's been abducted. I can't
simply leave her there.
