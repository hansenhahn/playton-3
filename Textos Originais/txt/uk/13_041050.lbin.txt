<T><A2/3>Isn't this usually when you like to
show off? You are planning to
rescue Flora, aren't you, Layton? 
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Of course. But how can I gain
access to the fortress's interior?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>We could try scaling one of its
legs...
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T>Foolish boy! You'd be squashed
flatter than a pancake!
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T><A4/1>Hey Layton, how would you like to
use your own car to get to the
fortress?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/6>You mean the one at the hospital?
But that was just a model to make
us believe we were in the future!
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T><A4/5>Hah! But I stole the blueprints for
it and made my own improved
Laytonmobile! Fully kitted out!
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T>I was saving it for a special
occasion, but too bad. I can
always make another one.
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T>The car is waiting for you on the
hill over there. Get a move on!
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A3/2>Many thanks, Paul.
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T><A5/5>Don't get all sappy on me, Layton.
I'm only doing this for Flora!
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T>I've parked your car up on that hill
over there. What are you waiting
for?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>My apologies, Paul. I'll go and fetch
it immediately!
