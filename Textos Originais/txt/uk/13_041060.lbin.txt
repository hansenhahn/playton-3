<T>Erm, there is one thing I need to
confess, Layton...
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>What is it, Paul?
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T>The truth is, the car's almost
ready, but I don't know which screw
to use on this last joint here.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/6>But the whole car could fall apart!
What are we going to do now?
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T>No need to get so shrill, brat!<W>
We can work it out. One of these
screws is sure to do the trick.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Hmm, I can't seem to find the right
one.
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T>Stop messing around, Layton!
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>It's not like YOU know which screw
to use either!
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Right, time to get this car running.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>This is the one. I'm sure of it!
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T><A1/2>I've got to hand it to you this time,
Layton. That was some fine work.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>So is the car ready to drive now?
!******************************!
<HDR:836883938145837C815B838B>
<T>You bet it is, boy.<W> Gentlemen, your
chariot awaits!
