<T>Hmm. I've been waiting for you,
Professor Layton. I was beginning to
think that Clive had got it wrong.
!******************************!
<T>We lost you for a second when that
idiot Lockjaw ran off...
!******************************!
<T>Clive certainly has it all worked
out, doesn't he?<W> What did he
send you here for?
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>Isn't it obvious?<W> I'm the muscle.
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>Now this is usually the point at
which I show you just how good I am
with a knife-
!******************************!
<T><A1/3>Watch out, Professor!
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Get behind me, you two!
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Hmm.<W> Now, now. No need to panic.
The only thing I'm throwing your
way today is this puzzle...
!******************************!
<T>Heh! Clive was right. You've bitten
off more than you can chew this
time, Professor.
!******************************!
<T>You think you can handle the cut
and thrust of this puzzle I'm
serving up?
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>Hmm. Looks like I was wrong about
that puzzle cutting you down.
!******************************!
<T>We can pass, then?
!******************************!
<T>Hmm. Yes, but only because Clive
instructed me not to touch a single
hair on any of your pretty heads.
!******************************!
<T>Otherwise I'd be showing you the
pointy end of my knife collection.<W>
If you know what I mean.
!******************************!
<T>Everyone stay away from him!
He could be lying!
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>Don't worry, boy. Orders are
orders. Besides, no one can stop
Clive.
!******************************!
<T>Now get moving. The boss hates
being made to wait.
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Just what is Clive planning with this
machine of his?
