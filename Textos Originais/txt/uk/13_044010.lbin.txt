<T>Look at all these monitors!
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>We should be able to see all parts
of the fortress from here.
!******************************!
<T>So we'll be able to find the location
of the generator room!
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>That's right, Luke. Now let's get
searching.
!******************************!
<T>Crikey. Maybe this isn't going to be

<T>We mustn't stop searching, Luke.
There are lives at stake.
!******************************!
<T>These monitors can help us pinpoint
the location of the generator
room.
!******************************!
<T>Ah, there it is!
!******************************!
<T>That's it, Luke!<W> Now all we have to
do is feed these coordinates into
the transport pod. Let's go!
!******************************!
<T>We're right behind you, Professor!
