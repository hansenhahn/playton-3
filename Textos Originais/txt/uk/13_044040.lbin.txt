<T><A1/6>Oh my gosh! That's Don Paolo's
flying machine!
!******************************!
<HDR:8354838A83418358>
<T>That's right. I begged him to fly me
up here, so he loaded me in and
sent me up.
!******************************!
<HDR:8354838A83418358>
<T>He controlled the machine from the
ground. I didn't have to do
anything. Amazing, isn't it?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>You can say that again!
!******************************!
<HDR:8354838A83418358>
<T>Funny, you don't seem so surprised,
Professor.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Well, I already knew Paul had his
machine with him.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/2>It's what he used to escape from
the research facility that we
infiltrated, isn't it, Celeste?
!******************************!
<HDR:8354838A83418358>
<T><A2/2>Nothing gets past you, does it,
Professor?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A3/1>So, now that we have Don Paolo's
flying machine, we can come and go
from here as we please.
!******************************!
<HDR:8354838A83418358>
<T>That's right, Luke.<W> <A2/6>Why, are you
thinking of abandoning our
mission?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Never! I just thought it might be a
good idea to drop Flora off
somewhere safe before heading on.
!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T><A1/5>No way! I'm staying here!
!******************************!
<HDR:8354838A83418358>
<T><A2/5>I can't say I blame you, Flora.
You've got to stick close to
the people you care about.
!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T>Yes, but it is good to know we can
<CR>return underground to continue
exploring</C>.
!******************************!
<HDR:8341838D837D>
<T>Should we wish to, I mean.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>All right, everyone, we really
shouldn't dawdle out here. We need
to head to the generator room.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Oh yes, I'd nearly forgotten. Let's
go, everyone!
