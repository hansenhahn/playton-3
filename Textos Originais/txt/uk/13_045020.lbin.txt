<T>Look at this device. It seems to be
monitoring the prime minister's
heartbeat.
!******************************!
<HDR:8354838A83418358>
<T>It will detonate the charge if the
sound of his heartbeat disappears.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Perhaps we can sever the
connection somehow.
!******************************!
<HDR:8354838A83418358>
<T>I wouldn't do that, Professor.
!******************************!
<HDR:8354838A83418358>
<T>See how there are two sets of wires
in the circuit?
!******************************!
<HDR:8354838A83418358>
<T>I don't think we'll be able to cut
both sets before the device
reacts.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A3/1>Amazing, Celeste. You obviously
possess a better understanding
of mechanics than I do.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Your sister would be very proud.
!******************************!
<HDR:8354838A83418358>
<T>Hey, I've just had an idea.<W> <A2/2>What
if we use this?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/1>That...is the pocket watch I gave
Claire, long ago.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>And here I thought it had been lost
in the explosion.
!******************************!
<HDR:8354838A83418358>
<T><A2/6>No... I actually found it when going
through Claire's things after the
accident.
!******************************!
<HDR:8354838A83418358>
<T>Unfortunately, the watch has been
broken since I found it.
!******************************!
<HDR:8354838A83418358>
<T>No matter how much I wind it up,
it never seems to run for more
than 10 minutes.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I see where you're going with this,
Celeste.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/1>You're suggesting we replace the
sound of the prime minister's heart
with that of the pocket watch?
!******************************!
<HDR:8354838A83418358>
<T><A1/1>Exactly. It's risky, but it seems
to be the only option we've got.
!******************************!
<HDR:8354838A83418358>
<T>We'll need to disconnect the circuit
from the prime minister and attach
the watch in one fell swoop.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A4/4>But even if we succeed, the watch
will stop running in 10 minutes and
the fortress will explode anyway!
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>We could end up putting the people
of London in real danger!
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A3/1>Luke, if we take no action, London
will face a greater danger than
any explosion.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>This is our only chance to stop
Clive. The chances of success
are slim, but we must try.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Argh. I'll have to try again.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I must get it right this time.
!******************************!
<HDR:8354838A83418358>
<T>Professor, that's it! The watch is
connected now!
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Yes, but our work here is far
from over.
!******************************!
