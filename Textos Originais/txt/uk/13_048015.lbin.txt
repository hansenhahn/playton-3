<T>My, what a commotion there is in
town today!
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>This place could be reduced to
rubble at any moment. Go quickly
to the clock shop on Midland Road!
!******************************!
<T>Really?<W> Fluke, my darling, did you
hear that? We've got to run!
!******************************!
<T><A1/3>Sorry, Belle. I'm going with the
professor to try to stop the
man responsible for this mess!
!******************************!
<T><A2/6>Oh Flukey... Your bravery makes me
weak at the knees.
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Belle, listen. You've got to get out
of here now.
!******************************!
<T><A3/5>If you tell me it's for the best,
Fluke, I'll do as you say. I trust
you.
!******************************!
<T><A3/7>But before you go, come close and
give your sweetheart a kiss for
good luck!
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>P-Professor! I think we should get
moving!
!******************************!
