here, Hershel.</V>
!******************************!

that hat I gave you.</V>

<V0050><T>What did you say?</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<V0060><T>Oi, there you are, Layton! I did a
background check on Claire's family,
like you asked.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:83608346838B837E815B>
<T><V0061>There's no record of Claire having
a younger sister.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0070><T><A1/1>Then...</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:83668342837E8367838A815B>
<V0080><T>Yes, it was quite a shock when
I first worked it out.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0090><T>But you... You can't really mean...</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:834E838C8341>
<V0100><T>It's me, Hershel. It's Claire.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:83668342837E8367838A815B>
<V0110><T>While it defies logic, it seems the
experiment 10 years ago wasn't
a complete failure.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:83668342837E8367838A815B>
<V0120><T>Somehow Claire was shot 10 years
into the future.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0130><T>To our present!</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:83668342837E8367838A815B>
<V0140><T>Yes. The time machine worked, if
only for that single moment before
it exploded.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0150><T>That's...that's not possible!</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:83668342837E8367838A815B>
<V0160><T><A1/4>Unfortunately, however, there
were more complications.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:83668342837E8367838A815B>
<V0170><T>Shortly after appearing in the
present, Claire's body showed signs
of...molecular instability.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:83668342837E8367838A815B>
<T><V0171>It was trying to return to its own
time.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:83668342837E8367838A815B>
<V0180><T>I attribute that phenomenon to
the incomplete nature of the time
machine. She didn't have long here.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:83668342837E8367838A815B>
<V0190><T>I worked on the machine in the
hopes of finding a way to stabilise
her existence in the present.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:83668342837E8367838A815B>
<V0200><T>But it seems inevitable that she'll
return to her own time...<W>to the
moment of the blast.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:834E838C8341>
<V0210><T><A4/4>I begged Dimitri to stop his work.
Tampering further with time can
only result in more anomalies.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:834E838C8341>
<V0220><T>There's no telling what chaos we'd
release upon the world if we tried
to save the dead from their fate.</V>

<HDR:834E838C8341>
<V0230><T>The flow of time must remain linear.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:834E838C8341>
<T><V0231>We all know the consequences
of changing its course.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:834E838C8341>
<V0240><T>But Dimitri wouldn't listen to me.
That's when I knew the only way to
stop him was through you, Hershel.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:834E838C8341>
<V0250><T>What Dimitri, Bill and I did 10 years
ago broke the laws of nature. And
now we must pay.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<V0260><T><A5/1>This is all so...incomprehensible.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:834E838C8341>
<V0270><T><A1/1>It's time to end this, Dimitri.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:83668342837E8367838A815B>
<V0280><T>Yes...it does seem that way.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:83668342837E8367838A815B>
<V0290><T><A1/1>My research has threatened our
very existence and it could do so
again.</V>
