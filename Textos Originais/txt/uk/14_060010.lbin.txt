<T><A5/0>Be straight with me, Layton. Can
you really stop that contraption?

<T><A4/2>If we let it carry on, there's no
telling how much damage it could do
to London!

<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I'll do my best to stop the machine.
In the meantime, I need you to get
everyone out of here.

<T>Lead everyone to the clock shop
and get them above ground as fast
as possible.

<T>Don't worry, Layton. I'll make sure
everyone is safe. You focus on
stopping that machine.

<T>Thank you, Inspector.

<T>I'll make sure everyone evacuates
the area safely. You just focus on
stopping Clive and his machine.
