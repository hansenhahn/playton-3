<T>All this time, I never imagined the
young sir was planning something
so terrible.
!******************************!
<T>You knew Clive's true identity from
the start, didn't you?
!******************************!
<T>Of course. The wife and I have
served the Dove family and the
young master for years.
!******************************!
<T>He was always such a good boy.
When he asked so nicely for my help,
I couldn't refuse.
!******************************!
<T>Had I known what he was up to,
I would never have agreed.
!******************************!
<T>It pains me to think that I might
have prevented all of this.
!******************************!
<T>Don't be too hard on yourself,
Cogg. What's done is done.
!******************************!
<T>Well, at the very least, I can try
to make up for what I've done.
!******************************!
<T>Tell everyone you meet to come
here and I'll take them above
ground using the lift.
!******************************!
<T>I'll make sure everyone down here
gets back to the surface safely.
!******************************!
<T>Please, just stop the young sir and
bring him back to us.
!******************************!
