<T><A4/1>Puzzles are the only way to pass
the time on these snooze-worthy
shifts.

<HDR:834E838D815B8393837D837483428341>
<T>See if you can wrap your thinkin'
gear around this head-scratcher I
cooked up.
!******************************!
<HDR:834E838D815B8393837D837483428341>
<T>Ha! I knew this puzzle would be too
much for a little kid like you.

<HDR:834E838D815B8393837D837483428341>
<T>Well well, look who's back for
another stab at my puzzle.
Good luck - you'll need it.

<HDR:834E838D815B8393837D837483428341>
<T>HUH? You solved it?<W> Oh great. Now
how am I supposed to get through
another borin' day on the job?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Boring?<W> Um, don't you work for a
crime syndicate? If your job's
boring, you're doing it wrong!

<T><A4/1>Huh? I must be hearin' things.
I could've sworn you just told
me how to do my job...
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/6>Eek!<W> Oh no no no! I didn't mean
anything by it. Just ignore me.

<HDR:834E838D815B8393837D837483428341>
<T><A1/1>I'm tryin' to think up a new
puzzle, but the well is dry.
!******************************!
<HDR:834E838D815B8393837D837483428341>
<T><A2/1>Nghh! How long do I have to wait for
inspiration to strike? There ain't
nothing worse than puzzler's block!
