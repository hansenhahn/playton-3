<T>So, spill the beans! Just how much
trouble has that hat got you into?

<T><A1/1>Oh, nothing serious, I assure you.
!******************************!
<HDR:8341836A815B835E>
<T>Really?<W> Still, that hat's trouble if
you ask me...
!******************************!
<HDR:8341836A815B835E>
<T><A3/1>But never mind that. Now that
you're here, there's something
I'd like your help with.
!******************************!
<HDR:8341836A815B835E>
<T>Whoops. Sorry, I didn't mean to
ask the impossible of you.
!******************************!
<HDR:8341836A815B835E>
<T>Are you here to help me out?<W>
You are?<W> Great! Here's what's
puzzling me.

<HDR:8341836A815B835E>
<T><A2/5>What's the deal with that hat of
yours then?
!******************************!
<HDR:8341836A815B835E>
<T>You must be awfully attached to it
if you keep it on knowing it could
cause you trouble.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A3/2>You're quite right about that.
I daresay this hat is one of my
most prized possessions.
!******************************!
<HDR:8341836A815B835E>
<T><A1/1>Well, I can see there's no
persuading you to take it off.
Be careful out there, though.
!******************************!
<HDR:8341836A815B835E>
<T>These days, it seems like there's
trouble around every corner in
London. 
!******************************!
<HDR:8341836A815B835E>
<T>Something to wet the whistle before
you head off?
