<T><A6/0><W><A3/1>Oh. Hello again, fellas.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Every time we see you, you have
your nose in the paper. You must
really like current affairs.
!******************************!
<T>That's the understatement of the
year. Just think - all the world's
news is here in these pages.
!******************************!
<T>How could I not devote my days to
perusing them?
!******************************!
<T><A4/4>But there are hardly any pictures!
And the print is so small! Doesn't it
get boring?
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>Boring?! The paper's bursting with
interesting stuff.<W> Like this puzzle,
for instance.
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>The youth of today just don't
appreciate print media like they
should.
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Want to have another look at the
paper?<W> Go ahead, help yourself.
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>So, now do you see why I read
this thing night and day?
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>Oh yes! I'm going to start reading
the paper too.<W> Once this case is
done.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Well, boy? Reading the paper much
these days?
!******************************!
