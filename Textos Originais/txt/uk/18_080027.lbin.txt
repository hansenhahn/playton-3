<T><A1/1>Every time we see you, you have
your nose in the paper. You must
really like current affairs.

<HDR:834583628359>
<T>That's the understatement of the

<HDR:834583628359>
<T>How could I not devote my days to
perusing them?

<T><A4/1>Oh yes! I'm going to start reading
the paper too.<W> Once this case is
done.

<HDR:834583628359>
<T><A1/1>Well, boy? Reading the paper much
these days?
