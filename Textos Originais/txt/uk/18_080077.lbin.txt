<T><A1/1>Toy cars?<W> Puh-lease.<A1/4> Those are
for babies.

<T><A3/1>That's strange. I could've sworn
I saw you playing with one of those
cars just a few minutes ago.

<T><A1/5>Keep it down, Chequer. I'm trying
to look cool here, yeah?

one hope you never grow out of toy
cars. You're my best customer! 
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>Well, they are really good fun...

<T><A3/1>Too right. I just wish Chequer
wouldn't go around letting
everyone know I like them!
!******************************!
<T>A fella's gotta try and look cool,
you know?<W> Speaking of cars,
though, I've got a puzzle for you!
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>Giving up?<W> Boooo.

me, I have some stuff I need to
take care of.<W> Cool stuff.
