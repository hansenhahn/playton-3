<T><A2/1>Welcome to Maya's Miles of Books!
Are you looking for anything in
particular today?
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Gosh, there are so many books I
want to read, but I don't get that
much pocket money!
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>That's a story I know all too well.
I could rarely afford all the books
I wanted to read as a child.
!******************************!
<T>But you know, if money's tight, you
can always go and read at the
library.
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Erm... Don't you think encouraging
customers to read at the library
might be bad for business?
!******************************!
<T><A5/1>Perhaps. But I'm all for anything
that gets more people interested in
reading.
!******************************!
<T>I like your enthusiasm!
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>You know, all this talk of money and
books just inspired me to think up
this puzzle.
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>Oh, was that too tough for you?
!******************************!
<T><A4/4>Yes, I'm stumped. But don't worry!
I'm usually really good at working
out how to spend money!
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>Our little chat about money and
books inspired me to pen this
puzzle.
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>Great puzzling!
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Thanks. I have to be pretty careful
with my pocket money, so solving
that puzzle was a doddle!
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Budgeting is hard work, but it makes
picking out that one special book
so much more fun!
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Hello again! Read any good books
lately?
!******************************!
