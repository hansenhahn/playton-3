<T><A1/1>The Laytonmobile certainly is in a
sad state.
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Poor thing. The tyres are wonky
and half its body's covered in moss.
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>No wonder it wouldn't start.
It's been neglected for ages.
!******************************!
<T><A4/5>And I took such good care of it
back in our own time, too. What
a shame...
!******************************!
<T>Taking the Laytonmobile for a
tune-up will be the first thing I do
when we get back to our time.
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>But while we're on the subject
of automobiles, have you ever
heard this one, Luke?
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>It's no use. The answer just
won't come to me right now.
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>This puzzle's going down!
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>It's amazing how you seem to have
a puzzle for every situation,
Professor.
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>I'm sure you'll be the same when
you get to my age, Luke.
!******************************!
<T>Besides, I needed something to
take my mind off the decrepit
state of the Laytonmobile.
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>I know you're upset, Professor,
but the Laytonmobile's not going
to budge. We'll have to walk.
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>What a pity.<W> It would have been
nice to get behind the wheel again.
!******************************!
