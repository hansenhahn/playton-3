<T><A2/2>Heya, Professor L. You didn't drop
by the campus just to say hi to
little old me, did you?
!******************************!
<T><A1/3>Of course he didn't! I don't know
what world you're living in, but
you've got it all wrong.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Well look who tagged along. I didn't
even realise you were there, short
stuff.
!******************************!
<T><A1/3>I'm pretty sure I told you before,
miss, but we're on a very important
case right now.
!******************************!
<T>Stop pestering the professor -
we've got work to do.
!******************************!
<T><A3/5>And how do you know I'm bothering
him? Can you read his mind? Do you
know all his likes and dislikes?
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>Let's find out!
!******************************!
<T><A3/5>Heh heh! See? You don't have a
clue what Professor L likes.
!******************************!
<T><A1/3>Don't be ridiculous. I...<W>I'll get it
next time! You'll see!
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>Can you pick Professor L's
favourite?<W> I bet you can't!
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Hmm. Maybe I was wrong about you,
little boy.
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>Of course you were! How could I
not know what the professor likes?
I am his apprentice, after all!
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>Well, consider me impressed. I'm
going to have to keep my eye on you.
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>Uh, you shouldn't. Really.
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>You know, you're not quite the
useless brat I thought you were.
!******************************!
<T>Don't get any ideas about us
hanging out, though. Babysitting
isn't my idea of fun.
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>Ugh! Don't worry about that!
!******************************!
