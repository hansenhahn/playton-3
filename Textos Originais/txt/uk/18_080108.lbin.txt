<T><A2/4>What was she thinking...?
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Is something the matter?
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>Yeah. I'm supposed to go to my
friend's house today, but I don't
know where it is.
!******************************!
<T>Her instructions make no sense at
all. They're absolute gibberish.<W>
Here, have a look.
!******************************!
<T><A2/4>Nope, that won't do it.
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>Hey, give me a hand with this will
you? I'm completely stuck here.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Hey, well done.<W> Recently I've been
playing with my friend, like, every
day.
!******************************!
<T><A2/5>My dad's never home and neither
are her parents.
!******************************!
<T>They all stay cooped up at the
research facility, day and night.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>So your father is a researcher?
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Him and almost everyone else in this
part of town.
!******************************!
<T>Interesting...
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Hey there. Out for a stroll or
something?
