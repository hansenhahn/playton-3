<T><A3/3>It's becomin' cleeear. I've just
seen a startlin' vision of your
fuuuture!
!******************************!
<T><A1/6>Woah! You scared me! Who are you,
anyway?
!******************************!
<T><A4/5>The name, boy, is Marzano. I have
been gifted with the power of
clairvoyance.
!******************************!
<T>Sadly, it is also my burden.
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>You mean you can see into the
future?
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>That's right. Not the whole future,
of course, but snapshots of other
people's futures.
!******************************!
<T>Here, let me show you.
!******************************!
<T><A4/5>It was foolish of me to think a boy
like you could understand the
terrible nature of my power.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Let me show you how my power
offers me a terrifyin' glimpse
into the fuuuture!
!******************************!
<T><A3/3>Wh-wha? How'd you know that?<W><A4/5>
Blow me down! You must have
powers an' all!
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Oh no, I'm not seeing into the
future. It's just a simple
matter of-
!******************************!
<T><A4/5>And here I was, thinkin' I was the
only one! I'm so glad there's
someone else like me in the world.
!******************************!
<T>Someone else who understands this
terrible and awe-inspirin' gift!
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>I don't think he's listening to you
any more, Luke. Let's leave him be.
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>No need to say a word, boy. I know
how you feel. And not just because
I'm clairvoyant.
!******************************!
<T>From now on, you and are gonna
shoulder this burden...<W>together.
!******************************!
<T><A4/4>Um, I think there's been some
misunderstanding here, sir...
