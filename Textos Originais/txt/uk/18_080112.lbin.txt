<T><A1/3>Hello there, sir. I must say, you've
got some nerve coming back here
after the mess you caused.
!******************************!
<T><A1/3>Hey, don't blame the professor! It
was your staff who decided to pick
a fight with us!
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>Maybe so, but that doesn't change
the fact that I got demoted for
letting you two in.
!******************************!
<T><A1/3>To be honest, I'm quite annoyed at
you two for getting me involved in
all this.
!******************************!
<T>But I'm not an unreasonable man.
I'm willing to let bygones be
bygones if you solve this puzzle.
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>What a pity. I was sure you'd breeze
through this puzzle, what with that
hat and everything.
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>Back to make amends for getting
me demoted? If you really want to
say sorry, solve this.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>This casino used to be a gathering
place for ladies and gentlemen of
impeccable taste, but no more.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Yes, I noticed that you're no longer
working the door.
!******************************!
<T>Does this mean you've done away
with membership cards?
!******************************!
<T><A2/2>That's right, sir. Financially,
we're no longer in a position to
pick and choose our customers.
!******************************!
<T>We're happy to take money from
anyone willing to lose it.
!******************************!
<T><A1/3>Welcome to the Gilded 7, where
you're guaranteed to hit the fun
jackpot every time.
