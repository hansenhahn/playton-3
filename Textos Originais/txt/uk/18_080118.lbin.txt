<T><A1/3>Some yobbo dropped a banana skin
here. How disgusting!
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Oh, what dreadfully uncouth
behaviour. Be a gentleman and pick
it up, would you, Luke?
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>No worries, Professor.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Oh, and while you're doing that,
here's a puzzle to make the chore
more fun!
!******************************!
<T><A1/5>This puzzle is one slippery customer!
!******************************!
<T>Let's have another look at that
banana skin puzzle, shall we?
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>There, all cleaned up. That's one
less banana skin littering the
streets of London!
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>Well done. Your thoughtfulness may
have just saved someone from
having a nasty slip.
