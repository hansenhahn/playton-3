<T><A3/1>Luke, do you see what I see?
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>I do. Yet another banana skin,
sitting in the middle of the road.
I'll go and pick it up.
!******************************!
<T><A4/5>Hold on, Luke!
!******************************!
<T><3/1>Why, what's wrong?<W> Oh wait...
Let me guess. You've got
another banana puzzle for me?

<T><A1/1>This banana skin puzzle is really
giving me the slip.
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>Ready to revisit that banana

!******************************!
<T><A4/1>These banana skins are all over
the place. Do people in the future
just love littering or what?
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>I'm starting to wonder...
