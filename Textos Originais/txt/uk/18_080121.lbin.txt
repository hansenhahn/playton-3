<T><A1/1>Welcome to London's most delicious
destination! I hope you brought
your appetites!
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>By the way... The postman tells me
you've got a real knack for solving
puzzles.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>I suppose you could say that. Why
do you bring it up, sir?
!******************************!
<T><A2/5>I ordered a few numbered plates
a while back you see, but the
company made a mistake...
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Stumped?<W> So am I! Don't worry, I'm
sure I'll work out what to do sooner
or later.
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Got any solutions to my numbered
plate dilemma?
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>It looks like I asked the right fella
for help! Cheers, I won't forget
this.
!******************************!
<T>There'll be more than a little extra
gravy on the next pie you order
here, believe me.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Drop by any time. I've got some new
dishes in the works that will leave
you both stunned and full! Har har!
