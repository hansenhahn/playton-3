<T><A2/1>Hrrrm?<W> I see you staring at me.
What do you need, boy?
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Oh, nothing, sir. I just saw you
there and thought I'd say hello.
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Hyaah haa haa!<W> You've got some
guts, trying to say hello to me.
It makes me laugh! Hyaah haa haa!
!******************************!
<T><A4/3>It's been a while since I had myself
a chuckle like that. Let me thank
you with a puzzle.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Hrrrm? Giving up, are we?
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Back to try again? Hyaah haa haa!
You've got gusto, boy. I like that.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Let this puzzle be a lesson to you.
If you're careless with your things,
you'll lose them.
!******************************!
<T>Here, take this. I found it over
there. You must have left it behind
the last time you were here.
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>Hrrrm. It's maddeningly quiet. I
cannot comprehend why the boss
would post me here.
