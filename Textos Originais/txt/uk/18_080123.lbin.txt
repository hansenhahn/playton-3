<T>Good day, Layton. How's your
investigation going?
!******************************!
<T><A1/2>I believe I'm making good progress -
with a little help from Scotland
Yard, of course.
!******************************!
<T>How about yourself, Inspector?
Have you come across any promising
leads?
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>I'd say so. You won't believe the
chat I heard a couple of suspicious
blokes having a moment ago.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Oh really?<W> Would you care to tell
me what you heard, perhaps?
!******************************!
<T><A3/5>Giving up, Layton? This puzzle might
contain information vital to both
our investigations, you know.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Layton, help me make sense of this
puzzle. Solving it might blow our
case wide open.
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>There, it's solved!
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>True, but unfortunately I don't see
any link between this puzzle and
our case.
!******************************!
<T><A2/6>Oh?<W> Hmm, yes, I suppose that's
true. Hrmph! Back to pounding the
pavement it is, then...
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>I'm going to get to the bottom of
this and rescue the prime minister.
You can bet on that, Layton.
!******************************!
