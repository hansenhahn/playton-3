<T><A1/1>There isn't any crime to be
organised in a peaceful park like
this. Hrrrm. How terribly boring. 
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>If things are too slow for you here,
why not move somewhere more,
erm...exciting?
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Hyaah haa haa! Would if I could,
boy, but I can't very well leave
my post here, can I?
!******************************!
<T>In that case, I hope you're using
your time here to do something
productive.
!******************************!
<T><A2/4>Hrrrm. Well, I often make up puzzles
when I have some time to myself.
Here, I'll share one with you.
!******************************!
<T><A4/4>Hmm. I'm going to have to come back
for this one later.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Hrrrm, care to take another run at
that frog puzzle?
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Hyaah haa haa! That's some brain
you've got there, boy.
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>I like you, so I'm going to give you
some advice that may just save
your hide one day.
!******************************!
<T>Stay away from the Family. I'm a
nice man, but I can't say the same
about the people I work with.
!******************************!
<T><A4/3>Keep out of our way and you'll have
nothing to worry about.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Hrrrm. Another uneventful day in
the park. Can't someone at least
try and start some trouble?
!******************************!
