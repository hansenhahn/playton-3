<T><A1/3>You there, what do you think
you're doing? Children in the
casino?! Have you lost your mind?
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Yikes!<W> S-sorry, sir! We didn't mean
to break the rules of your
establishment.
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>If you're really sorry, prove it
by solving this puzzle. It's been
bothering me all day.
!******************************!
<T><A3/8>If you don't even have the nous to
solve this puzzle, you're going to be
leaving here with empty pockets.
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>Ah, so you're back to try and
make amends again?<W> Well, go on
then. Get solving!
!******************************!
<T><A2/5>Oh, it looks like you solved that
puzzle. Thanks for entertaining me.
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>What do you mean, {''}entertaining{''}
you? Didn't you say that puzzle had
been bothering you all day?
!******************************!
<T><A1/4>I did say that, but I was lying. I was
just bored and wanted someone to
chat to.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Chat? But don't you have work to
be doing? Considering you own the
casino?
!******************************!
<T><A1/4>Ah yes...I lied about that too.
Sorry, I was so bored I just
couldn't help messing with you two. 
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>In reality I'm just a normal, 
everyday chap.<W> <A4/9>My name's Mark,
in case you're wondering.
!******************************!
<T><A3/8>I hope you remember my name. No one
ever seems to, and it makes me feel
ever so lonely.
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Wow, this London really is full
of weirdos.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Crikey, if I were any more bored,
I'd be growing splinters.
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>But you're in a casino! If you're
that bored, why not go and play a
few games?
!******************************!
<T><A1/4>Ha! I would if I could, but I've
already put every penny I had
into the slots here.
!******************************!
<T>Oh...
!******************************!
