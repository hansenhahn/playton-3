<T><A1/4>Aw, what a rotten day.

<T><A3/1>Why are you so down in the dumps?
!******************************!
<T><K><A2/5>Mmm?<W></K> Oh hello there, little chappie.
I was just thinking about my son,
which made me all sad.
!******************************!
<T>He loves swimming, you see, which
got me thinking about this puzzle.
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>Aw, now don't you go getting down
as well. You can always try that
puzzle again later.
!******************************!
<T><A2/5>Thinking about my little boy back
home reminded me of this puzzle.
!******************************!
<T><A1/4>I wonder how big my son's got while
I've been away. I do so wish I could
see him.
!******************************!
<T><A1/4>Yeah, I do wish I could go back
home. It'd be nice to see my family.
