<T>Have a look at this X-ray.
!******************************!
<T><A4/4>Hmm. Do you think it's
Dr Schrader's?
!******************************!
<T>I believe so. But there's something
odd about it. Have a look here,
Luke.
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>Curious. Whatever could have
caused that strange shadow to
appear on the X-ray?
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>Something about this X-ray is not
quite right.
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>That's not funny at all. Who would
try to play a prank like that on
poor Dr Schrader?
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Now Luke, let's not jump to any
conclusions. Andrew is quite the
prankster himself.
!******************************!
<T>It's entirely possible that he placed
this fake X-ray here to shock his
visitors.
!******************************!
<T><A4/4>If that's the case then it certainly
worked on me. I was really worried
for a moment there!
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>Some people are willing to go the
extra mile to pull off a good
practical joke.
!******************************!
