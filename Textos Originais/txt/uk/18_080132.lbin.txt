<T><A1/2>Hello Barton. How is everything
going?
!******************************!
<T>I was just taking a break to, um,
reflect upon a case the inspector
and I were on the other day.
!******************************!
<T><A4/1>I see. What exactly happened on
that case?
!******************************!
<T>We had to chase a suspect across
the river, but I can't remember how
long it took... Chew.
!******************************!
<T>Hard to - chomp chomp - work it
out, isn't it, Professor?<W> Gulp!
!******************************!
<T>Now then, just how long did it take
- om nom - to cross that river?
!******************************!
<T>Ah yes, that's right. Thanks for
helping me to remember. Now I can
finally get back to<W>...snacking.
!******************************!
<T>Chew<W>.<W>.<W>.<W>gulp! This steamed pork bun
is dreamy.
