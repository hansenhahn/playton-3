<T>Watch out, fellas! Can't y'see
you're standing in the middle
of a building site?!

<T><A3/2>It's good to see that you're making
progress with the construction
work.

<HDR:835E83438389815B>
<T><A3/1>Pfft, if only that were the case.
We've hit a snag, see. Look at these
boards here.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A4/1>They're a very odd shape. What are
you using them for?
!******************************!
<HDR:835E83438389815B>
<T>Diddly-squat. I've got crates of
these things, but I can't use them.
!******************************!
<HDR:835E83438389815B>
<T>I need square boards, y'see. What's
a man to do?
!******************************!
<HDR:835E83438389815B>
<T>Yeah, it's useless. Thanks for your
help, but I think we'll just have to
order new boards.
!******************************!
<HDR:835E83438389815B>
<T>Got any bright ideas that might help
fix my problem?
!******************************!
<HDR:835E83438389815B>
<T><A2/1>Hey, look at that! One cut and I've
got square boards. Thanks for the
idea, mate!
!******************************!
<HDR:835E83438389815B>
<T><A2/1>Thanks for fixing that board
problem. We're undermanned, y'see,
so help is always appreciated.
