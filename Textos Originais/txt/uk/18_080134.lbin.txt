problem solvers. Thanks again for
helping me with those boards.

<T><A1/2>It was nothing really, just a bit of
thinking and a well-placed cut.
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Yeah? Well, if it ain't too much
trouble, you think you could work
your magic on these boards too?
!******************************!
<T>No luck, eh?<W> Yeah, these boards are
even harder to work with than the
last set we had.
!******************************!
<T>You want to help me with these
boards?<W> Great! Hang on, I'll go
and get my saw!
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>Look at that! Mate, you did it again!
!******************************!
<T>Thanks to you, we're that much
closer to giving Midland Road the
refurb it deserves.
!******************************!
<T>This project's been undermanned
from day one, so I might need your
help another time as well.
