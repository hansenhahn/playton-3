<T>Visiting the casino in the middle of
the day? Some people have such
poor self-control.
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>Isn't that a bit of a hypocritical
thing for you to say?
!******************************!
<T><A1/3>You've got a big mouth on you,
boy.<W> You, sir, should teach this
child some manners!
!******************************!
<T><A3/1>I do apologise. Luke can get a little
worked up at times.
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>Hmph, you're lucky I'm in a good
mood. Solve this puzzle and I'll
forget about the whole thing.
!******************************!
<T><A3/8>If you don't even have the brains
to solve this puzzle, you're going
to be kissing your money goodbye.
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>You'd better solve this puzzle if you
want me to forgive that rude
remark you made earlier.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>Nicely done, boy. Watching you solve
that was a nice way to stave off
boredom for a few minutes.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>So...are you always here at the
casino?
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>Yeah, I don't have much else to do.
Besides, have you looked out of
the window recently?
!******************************!
<T>London's filled with Family
henchmen. You'd have to be crazy
to wander around out there!
!******************************!
<T><A1/4>Those thugs have scared just about
everyone in town into following
their orders.
!******************************!
<T><A1/4>What else can a good citizen like me
do but hide indoors where it's safe?
!******************************!
<T>I see.
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>If you're going to run around
outside, don't let the Family
spot you!
