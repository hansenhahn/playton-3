<T>Ah, there's a lovely breeze blowing
through London today.

<T>I couldn't agree more.

<T>It's the perfect day to find a nice
grassy spot near the river - or to
go for a walk.

<T><A3/5>Speaking of walks, my hubby and I
came up with this great puzzle while
we were out one day.

<HDR:8369835E815B83568383>
<T>Aww, you're giving up?

<HDR:8369835E815B83568383>
<T><A3/5>My hubby and I thought up this
puzzle when we were out for a
riverside stroll.

<HDR:8369835E815B83568383>
<T>You're a clever one, aren't you?
Nice work there!

<T><A2/1>Ah, I used to love walking with my
hubby. Back then he used to come
home for dinner every night.

<T><A3/5>Sadly, those carefree walks ended
as soon as we got here.

<T>They must be working him like a dog
at that new job of his, because he
hardly ever comes home!

<HDR:8369835E815B83568383>
<T><A1/1>Ah, the breeze today is just
blissful. I wish my hubby would finish
work so we could go for a picnic.
