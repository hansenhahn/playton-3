<T><A3/1>What an unusual building. It's like
it has a little family of roofs.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T><A1/1>Yes, this style of architecture
became popular after your time.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A4/1>So that's why it seems so strange
to me!
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T><A2/2>You know, your comment about the
roofs being like a family reminds
me of a puzzle I once heard.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>Would you like to try it?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A2/2>Do you even need to ask?
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>Don't get discouraged. We can
always try this one again later.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T><A2/4>Come on, Luke! Make the professor
proud.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T><A2/5>Wonderful! Of course, I expected
nothing less from myself. Heh heh.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A3/2>Nor should you! No puzzle is a match
for Professor Layton's apprentice,
after all!
