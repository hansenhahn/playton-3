<T><A1/5>This place is a mess! That droopy
flower has even got some kind of
insect buzzing around it!
!******************************!
<HDR:8369838C815B835683878393>
<T>Hold it right there, sonny boy!
I wouldn't go bad-mouthing that
blossom if I were you.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/3>Augh! There's someone lurking in
the shadows!
!******************************!
<HDR:8369838C815B835683878393>
<T>Ehee hee, oh yes. Wherever there
are lost puzzles, there am I.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/1>Oh, it's you!
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B836F>
<T>Have we met before?
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B836F>
<T>No? Well then, allow me to introduce
myself!
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B836F>
<T>Before you stands the beautiful and
clairvoyant Granny Riddleton.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/6>B-beautiful?<W> Hmm, well you do
look pretty good for your age, I
suppose.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/1>Watch your words, Luke! We don't
want to offend the lady, do we?
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B836F>
<T><A1/5>Have you ever noticed how many
mysteries there are in the world?<W>
How many puzzles?
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B836F>
<T>Puzzles that tease your brain?
Puzzles that bend your mind?
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B836F>
<T>Puzzles that are just plain
infuriating?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A3/1>Certainly.
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B836F>
<T>And what about the puzzles that you
miss or leave unsolved? They've got
to go somewhere, haven't they?
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B836F>
<T>Where do they go, you ask?<W> Well,
they come and stay with me!
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A4/2>That's very good to know.
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B836F>
<T><A1/1>Or I suppose I should say they used
to come and stay with me. Things
are about to change.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A3/1>Are they?
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B836F>
<T>You might not be able to tell from
my looks, but I'm no spring chicken.<W>
Truth be told, I'm getting tired.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/1>Oh?
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B836F>
<T>I think it's time for me to retire
from this puzzle-minding business.
I've earned it.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>But...
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/3>You can't retire! You mustn't!
Without you, what will happen to
all the puzzles we leave behind?
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B836F>
<T>Are you saying that without me, you
two would find yourselves in a
pickle?
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A4/4>A huge pickle!
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B836F>
<T>How about the debonair gentleman
in the top hat? What do you think?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>I concur with my friend here.
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B836F>
<T>Ehee hee.<W> Yep, I thought you might
say that.
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B836F>
<T>But don't fret. I'll make sure you're
taken care of.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/1>How?
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B836F>
<T><A1/6>Ehee hee!<W><A1/1> You'll just have to wait
and see for yourselves, laddies.
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B836F>
<T>Come back here when you've lost a
few puzzles. It should all become
clear then.
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B836F>
<T>Now, I know we just met, but you'll
have to excuse me. I'm going off on
a well-deserved holiday.
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B836F>
<T>I may never see you again, so
ta-ta, and have a positively
puzzly day!
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>A...puzzly day?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/2>What a strange conversation that
was. Let's be sure to come back
here later.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/1>Definitely.<W> Though that thing
that's flying around is giving me the
heebie-jeebies.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>I wonder where Granny Riddleton is
going on holiday?
