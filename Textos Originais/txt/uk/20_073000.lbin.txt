<V0040><T><A1/1>You know, I've never seen a bee
quite like this. Can you try talking
to him, Luke?</V>

<HDR:838B815B834E>
<V0050><T>I suppose I can try.</V>

<V0060><T><A1/1>Well, look at Mr Tall Hat here.
Clearly he knows a bee of
distinction when he sees one.</V>

it's true. I'm no run-of-the-hive
bee, but I do try to blend in.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<V0090><T>You'd probably have better luck
blending in if you didn't talk.</V>

But listen, I've got something you
