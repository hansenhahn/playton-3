<T><A2/2>I see you've managed to lay down
a rough sketch of the whole mural.
It looks excellent.

<T>Heh heh! It really is something else,
isn't it? I'm glad I asked those
kids to do the job.

<T><A3/1>So are you going to colour in the
rest of the piece now?

<T><A3/2>Of course! It'll be exploding with
colour when it's done! It's just
going to take a little while.

<T><A3/5>I bet you can hardly wait, eh?<W>
Maybe this puzzle about painting
will help you pass the time.

<T>Was that puzzle too tough for you?
Sorry about that!

<HDR:835F837E83418393>
<T>Ready to paint in an answer for this
puzzle?

puzzles. I'm tickled pink.

<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A1/2>Thank you, and good luck with the
rest of your mural. I'm sure the
finished work will be wonderful.
