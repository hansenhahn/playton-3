<T><A3/2>Wow! Look at all those great

!******************************!
<T><A3/5>I'm pretty keen on them myself. Yep,
the kids are doing a great job.

<T><A4/1>The kids? You're not doing any of
the painting yourself?

<T><A3/2>Nah, I'm more of a spectator than
a painter.

<T><A1/1>But I try to help the team as best
I can by preparing paint, washing
brushes and so on.
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Well, as long as you're having fun!
