<T><A1/2>The mural looks as though it's
almost finished!
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Yep, we're pretty close now! It's a
real beauty. You won't find another
mural like this in all of London.
!******************************!
<T>Heh heh! I'm very proud, I have to
say.
!******************************!
<T>Proud?<W> But didn't you say you have
local children doing all the work?
!******************************!
<T><A2/1>Well, they're doing the painting, but
I've done a lot of the heavy lifting!
!******************************!
<T>Literally, in fact! I carried all the
paint myself!
!******************************!
<T><A3/5>You know, one of the pots had this
great puzzle on the side of it.
Here, have a look!
!******************************!
<T><A4/2>My, you certainly have an affinity
for paint, don't you?
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Couldn't solve it, eh? Yep, that
puzzle's a real stumper.
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>This puzzle requires some serious
thought.
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Wow, I think you two are the best
puzzle solvers I've ever met!
!******************************!
<T><A3/2>Well, we do get a lot of practice.
!******************************!
<T><A4/6>Impressive stuff, though. Heh heh!
!******************************!
<T><A1/1>You have to come back soon to see
the greatest mural in London in its
finished state.
