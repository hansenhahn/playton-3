<T>Tell me, did you happen to notice
that peculiar flower growing in the
abandoned shop on Midland Road?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Erm... Why, what's so special about
this particular flower?
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>It supposedly attracts puzzles that
have disappeared from their
original locations.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A1/6>Like a Venus flytrap for puzzles?!
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T><A2/2>That's what they say, anyway.
I've never seen it for myself.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>But if those rumours are true,
we'll be able to retrieve any
puzzles we've left behind.
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>I'd say that's reason enough to
visit the shop.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T><A3/1>What do you say, Professor?
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T>Well, we've nothing to lose, I
suppose.
!******************************!
<HDR:838C834383678393>
<T><A2/2>The shop in question is just a quick
stroll away and being able to visit
lost puzzles would be very useful.
!******************************!
<HDR:838B815B834E>
<T>Then what's stopping us? Let's go!
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T><A3/2>Don't you want to go and have a
look at the flower that started all
those rumours?
!******************************!
<HDR:96A29788838B815B834E>
<T>It's growing not far from here, in
the abandoned shop on Midland
Road.
