<V0010><T>Oi! Come by to dig into a few
puzzles, did ya?</V>

<T>That flower keeps hold of puzzles
you've left behind!
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B8372815B>
<T>Puzzles you've left behind are
packed inside that bloom.
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B8372815B>
<V0020><T>So go on! Get to it!</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B8372815B>
<T>Leaving too many unsolved puzzles
lying around can come back to sting
you.
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B8372815B>
<V0030><T>So don't just stand there with your
mouth hanging open. Tap that
flower and get solving!</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B8372815B>
<T>Puzzles you left behind because they
were too tough, or whatever,
are hiding in that blossom.
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B8372815B>
<V0040><T>And they will not be ignored!</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B8372815B>
<T>Flowers like that are fascinating
plants. Puzzles just love to gather
around them.
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B8372815B>
<V0050><T>Sounds weird, I know, but if you
want to see what I mean, just give
it a tap.</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B8372815B>
<T>I wouldn't advise letting that
flower get overburdened with
puzzles, you follow?
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B8372815B>
<V0060><T>All I'm saying is, don't leave puzzles
for tomorrow when you can solve
them today!</V>
!******************************!
<HDR:8369835D815B8372815B>
<T>...Bzzz?
