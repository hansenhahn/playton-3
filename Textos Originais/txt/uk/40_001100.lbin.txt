Professor Layton has received a
mysterious letter. The sender
claims to be Luke from 10 years
in the future, but how can this be
possible?
!******************************!
A grown-up Luke used a time
machine to send the letter back
to the present, requesting the
help of his former teacher,
Professor Layton, in rescuing the
chaotic future city of London.
!******************************!
Prime Minister Bill Hawks
mysteriously disappeared in the
accident at the time machine
presentation. What could
possibly have happened to him?
!******************************!
Prime Minister Bill Hawks, who
was unaccounted for after the
accident at the time machine
presentation, was discovered by
Professor Layton in the future
London. He was abducted by Dimitri
and is now being held prisoner. Will
the heroes be able to rescue him?
!******************************!
When Professor Layton and Luke
emerged from the clock shop,
the streets of London suddenly
looked quite different. What
could have happened?
!******************************!
The strange, unfamiliar streets
belong to a future London from
10 years after Professor Layton
and Luke's time.
!******************************!
Future London turned out to be
a fake city built in an underground
cavern beneath the real London.
Dimitri led his team of scientists
to believe that they were trapped
in the future so that they would
put every effort into completing a
functioning time machine.
!******************************!
Many people in this part of London
seem to be afraid of Professor
Layton. Why would ordinary people
who've never met him fear the mild
and gentlemanly Layton?

It seems to be something to do
with his hat...
!******************************!
In the future, the city of London
is in the thrall of an evil Layton.
The sight of the professor, who
looks just the same as his future
self, is enough to spark fear
among the local people.
!******************************!
This young man sent Professor
Layton a letter, claiming to be
Luke from the future. But how is
that even possible?
!******************************!
The young man signing himself {''}Luke
Triton{''} turned out to be an older
Luke from 10 years in the future.
He wrote to his old trusted
teacher to request his aid.
!******************************!
Future Luke is really a young man
named Clive who lost his parents in
the time machine accident 10 years
ago. He has been planning his
revenge on those responsible
ever since. He called upon Layton
hoping that the professor could
save him from his own madness.
!******************************!
A selection of shady characters,
all dressed identically in grey,
seem to lurk on every street
corner in the future London.
What are they up to?
!******************************!
The shady characters dressed
in grey are members of a gang
under the control of the future
Layton, the boss of the London
underworld.
!******************************!
The future Hershel Layton is a
crime lord who terrorises London
with his gang of thugs. Known and
feared by Londoners as {''}the
devil in the top hat{''}, how
could this model English gentleman
have turned into such a monster?
!******************************!
The future Layton turned out to
be Dimitri Allen, the famous
scientist renowned for his
research into time travel.
But what was Dimitri's reason
for posing as a future Professor
Layton?
!******************************!
Dr Stahngun is the scientist who
unveiled the time machine at the
presentation, but no records
exist of a scientist with that
name. He must be somebody else,
using an alias to cover up his
true identity. Who is he really?
!******************************!
Dr Stahngun is really Dimitri Allen,
one of the scientists involved in
the time machine accident 10 years
ago.
!******************************!
A woman who looks uncannily like
Professor Layton's old
sweetheart, Claire, is wandering
around town. Who could she be?
!******************************!
The enigmatic woman is none other
than Claire's younger sister,
Celeste. She came to the future
London in search of clues as to
the circumstances of her sister's
death, and is following Professor
Layton in the belief that he will
uncover the truth.
!******************************!
Celeste turns out to be Claire
herself, sent into the present
from the day of her accident 10
years ago. Accepting her fate, she
bids farewell to Professor Layton
and travels back to her own time,
to the day of her tragic accident.
!******************************!
Men in white laboratory coats
seem to be all over this part
of town, but the odd thing is that
their trouser bottoms and shoes
are always soaking wet. What 
reason could they have for
walking around London with wet
feet?
!******************************!
The white-clad men walking around
with wet feet are in fact
scientists put to work by Dimitri
in his research laboratory. They
walk through a partially flooded
tunnel under the River Thames to
get into town when they want a bit
of a break from the labs.
!******************************!
