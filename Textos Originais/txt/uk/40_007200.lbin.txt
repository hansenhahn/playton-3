The secret to a long life is plenty
of sleep and exercise, don't you
know. Speaking of exercise, let me
tell you about the route I take on
my afternoon walks!
!******************************!
Oi lads, we've got work to do!
We've gotta grab all this cash
and bang it into the safe, boss's
orders! Make sure you get the lot!
!******************************!
Hey Fluuuke! Your bride-to-be
can't wait to see you again,
sweetie! And I'm bringing cakes!
Aren't you just dying to taste
them?
!******************************!
Oh nyet! I'm lost again, and this
time in the desert! I've got to
get to the coast for some agua
before I dry up like a prune... But
how? Oh bitte, amigo! Help me!
!******************************!
That Max! He rushed off ahead to
the hotel and dropped all his toys
along the way. Now I have to
follow the trail of toys and pick
them all up!
!******************************!
Oh dear! The inspector has called
me out to an emergency! I'll be
in for it if I don't get to the
crime scene soon! I just can't
resist all those cakes, though...
!******************************!
This course is my humble gift to
you. Looks easy, but what about
the gold coins you have to
plunder? You're going to have to
be creative to get all those!
!******************************!
This is my secret carrot patch
and it's about time to dig the
little beauties up. They look so
juicy and tasty! It'll be fresh
carrot salad for dinner!
!******************************!
I'm in big trouble! I spent a little
too long in the casino last night
and lost all my money. I need to
get my hands on some cash before
the Family come after me!
!******************************!
Well, well! Congratulations on
getting this far! Allow me to
reward you with this last course.
It should be a piece of cake for
an expert such as yourself!
