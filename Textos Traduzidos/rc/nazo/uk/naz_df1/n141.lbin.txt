The bridge below has been painted in a
black-and-white check pattern.

Starting from the bottom-left arrow, you
need to cross the bridge and finish at
the top-right arrow. You can move one
square at a time, either up, down, left
or right. You can't move diagonally.

Now here's the tricky part: how many
different routes across are there that
cross exactly four black squares and
three white squares?
!******************************!
[ec0b01000b000000:02a2010000]
Precisely!

There are 15 different routes. More than
you'd think, eh?
!******************************!
[ed0b01000c000000:02e8010000]
Too bad!

You can move vertically and horizontally,
but not diagonally.

Count the routes again.

Your task is to find all the routes
that meet the conditions. Think about
how each route crosses the central
column of squares on the bridge.

Crossing four black squares and three
white ones means you have to cross the
bridge in seven moves, so you can't
afford to backtrack.
!******************************!
[ef0b01000e000000:025e030000]
Once you've worked out the pattern
in the routes that work, just go
ahead and count them one by one.

As Hint 1 mentioned, backtracking
won't work. Keep the other conditions
in mind and you should be fine.

One route is to go straight up to the
top row and then turn right.

Another is to go straight to the second
row from the top, turn right, and then
head up again when you reach the
rightmost column.

These are just two of several different
possibilities. Count each one!
!******************************!
[f10b010010000000:023a050000]
There are more than 10 routes, but
fewer than 20.

Keep on counting!
