{''}Well now, can you reach the top of this
gate again? If you think you've solved
this puzzle before, think again!{''}

This time, it's quite a lot harder...

[ec0b01000b000000:02b0000000]
Very impressive!

{''}You may pass.{''}

[ed0b01000c000000:02d8000000]
Too bad!

Try again.

There are multiple ways to solve this
puzzle. Here's one example:

First, move the yellow block above
Professor Layton and Luke up and to
the right so that it's mostly on top
of the red block. Then move Professor
Layton and Luke over to the left.

Start from there and see how far you
can get!

Continuing from Hint 1, move the red
block down to the bottom and then the
yellow block down on top of it.

Now move the blue block down and over
to the left, on top of Layton and Luke.

Continuing from Hint 2, move the yellow
and red blocks up, then slide Layton and
Luke to the right, under the red block.

Now move the blue block down to the
bottom and over to the right, next to
Layton and Luke.

Continuing from Hint 3, move the yellow
block over to the left wall and down on
top of the blue block. Then slide the
green block down as far as you can and
move the orange block up into the goal
square. Now move the green block back
to where it started.

See if you can work the rest out from
there.
